A documenter who takes this assignment should start looking for the agenda the Monday before and asking for the Zoom information, as the website does not have the meeting time or the correct number. It is assumed all meetings are held virtually. The central office staff doesn’t even know anything about the board of commissioners from meeting dates, times, agendas, minutes, and the unnamed woman I spoke with on the phone admitted she only knew about the Dekalb County Board of Commissioners and in her attempt to help was going to give the county clerk’s phone number until I had to tell her about the structure of the organization.  I think this organization is also privatized as well. There is no background on the agenda items as well either. The organization will speak in codes, so familiarize yourself with the lingo on the website to learn the acronyms.

The conference call number was incorrect on the website, and it sounded like it was a Zoom platform when I dialed in as others got to see themselves, but I was on the phone in.

There is a large pillar in the middle of the room which blocks the view of the podium. It also makes it difficult to see all board speakers unless seated at the edge of the room near the camera person and ASL interpreters.

As the President of the board didn't know any of the new board members names he didn't name them or call on them they just started talking and it was difficult to identify who was who.

Several of the items related to explicit votes seem to have been decided upon our of order and were missed because I arrived late. I learned that early attendance for these meetings will be critical as 1) each district council meeting can conduct itself with a great deal of flexibility/variance and 2) most of the voluntary members are going to try and get through the meetings as quickly as possible as they aren't directly paid for it.

As well, Board Member Kooper's silence, general confusion or apathy toward the business of the meeting, and assistance from a member of the public was distracting not only as a viewer but also to other Board Members who regularly looked towards him or had to answer on his behalf.

She once again called me a parasite and then proceeded to go around to other officials in the meeting and tell other people about how my work was ""parasitic"" and how I am a ""fly on the wall."" she was the only staffer whose name tag (which were different from the ones used by the public) was turned around so you couldn't see her name.

14613,"When attending a meeting virtually for coverage, I always run into the question on this checklist form for counting how many people showed up, and the answer box will only allow numerical figures (the form won't send if you try to send an answer other than just numbers). I'm hoping this part of the form, in the future, is adjusted, since types of public meetings vary, and when attending virtually one can't always know how many people are in attendance, but can give a best description. 

In other support, I would love to practice and work in training, tips and implementing best methods for timestamping (outline or draft suggestions, especially as someone who often handwrites or otherwise takes down shorthand in a notepad, as a separate first draft before filling out the template). For this assignment, for example, I have a paper notepad around 8 by 11 inches, and with so many testimonies (more than I've heard at any other public meeting in light of the 76er's Arena development) I found I shorthanded 20 physical pages full top to bottom. If I find a good way of notes transfer without the mathing hassle, or any tricks myself, I hope in a future workshop it could be worth sharing and weigh methods brainstorming together :) 

Lastly, this assignment, as quiet as I needed to be recording the audio, I definitely found myself accidentally sobbing and silently cheering into my notebook hearing the testimonies of my neighbors, relating hard, learning from others and sharing our home together.

13823,"Blurb: The Department of Neighborhoods All Districts Meeting presented brief budgets for FY25 for several departments. Department representatives presented from the Public Lighting Department, Public Lighting Authority, Detroit Fire Department, Detroit Health Department, and Detroit Police Department. The meeting was well-organized and featured engagement between city officials and community members.

The meeting had over 100 people in virtual attendance, with active engagement from the community. Many questions and comments were directed towards the lighting department and authority, and to the police department. Commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the rates of unsolved homicides given the large budget of DPD, and an apparent lack of transparency. However, DPD was also commended on the statistics provided that show improvements in crime rates. Community members inquired how to get alleys lit, and noted the small budget dedicated to removing trees. They acknowledged that the $500,000 budget only allows tree trimming in 5-10 neighborhoods annually.

The City of indy is very excited and eager to work with the Chief and continuing reducing crime and bettering the community for the good. Moral and Recruitment are the main focus the council and chief police agreed to partner with to accomplish together as well with the community. It was good stuff.

Detroit Public Schools Community District’s School Board met Tuesday September 10th at Martin Luther King Jr. High School. After starting more than five minutes late, the board changed the tone in the room within the first few minutes when they re-arranged the agenda to place a closed session before public comment. After a one hour closed session, numerous attendees who signed up for public comment at the beginning of the meeting were gone once the agenda item was finally addressed. Paraprofessionals from across the district voiced their demands for increased wages, affordable health insurance, and safer working conditions. Various commenters vocalized their preferred candidates for the upcoming school board elections, and were met with their mics being silenced. Multiple callers asked the board to provide school buses for students in Bangalatown and Hamtramck to go directly to Cass Tech, Dr. Vitti questioned if the move would create inequity.

Highland Park City Council met Tuesday September 3rd. Multiple issues garnered vigorous debate. Council initially considered removing the ability for the city to apply for a grant for EV Charging stations but finally approved the resolution to apply. Even though multiple residents spoke in support of the current Interim Treasurer taking the vacant City Treasurer seat, Council disagreed and still decided not to fill the vacant seat. Finally, Council voted to approve a moratorium on water shutoffs due water increases that were supposed to be temporary but have lasted 3 months longer than estimated with no end in sight.

However, the commission was divided when it came to a proposed Savvy Sliders on Cadieux. Despite a recommendation from staff to approve a newly-drawn plan for Savvy Sliders, the commission was divided 3-3, resulting in a failed motion. However, the fate of the rezone Savvy Sliders is requesting ultimately lies in the hands of the City Council.

Several non-voting items came before the commission. Hart Plaza has plans to demolish the stairs and create a multi-level plaza with an accessible entrance to the Riverwalk. MHT Housing updated the council on updates to affordable senior housing at Gesu. The City of Detroit Planning Department gave master plan updates, discussed the Master Plan Advisory Group, and described how they are trying to engage with the community.

For Douglas Park representatives they emphasized how the park district has allowed  privatization of the park and little to no renovation has been done in about 8 years outside of a new pavement .

12650,"In the context of this particular kind of organizational public meeting, I feel like the part that was brought to my attention was identification in attendance, identifying as press and in security realms however over Zoom or otherwise in a remote-meeting setting. I emailed the CPOC in case whether myself or the purveyors of the meeting itself, or even just technical circumstances kept from being able to use the Zoom platform or device in a kind of setting where you need to prep but also have to think on your feet in the moment. It did make me think to hope to have future workshops focused on using remote platforms with our media platform as Documenters, as a team and organization. That would totally rock! I can imagine a kind of tech muscle memory of exactly what to do say just in the minutes leading up to a meeting, signing in and knowing exactly what menus and toggles to use. Much like my past background being a professional photographer, as a beginner my equipment felt unwieldy but I would do with anything I could capture (which was also the training advice). However, years later, even now, taking photos in all the technical ways in the moment feels like an extension of my body and being. AFter doing some professional things for so many years, it's so funny that you just go into motion without a thought, naturally. I don't have a ton of experience using Zoom, but I know nowadays it has become a household name. So I hope in the future for getting on assignment one can just slide right into a meeting and know just where to go, how to troubleshoot and communicate (whether in a meeting or about how the technology is working when the meeting time is lights, camera and action).

Blurb: The Wayne County Ethics Board spent just as long resolving technical issues as they did on meeting content. After technical issues were resolved, the board discussed an existing complaint against Commissioner Martha Scott. A hearing was set for July 17. The chair bemoaned that they could not subpoena attendees–this has been a failed effort of board members in the past.

The Board of Police Commissioners referred a complaint to the Ethics Board about an incarcerated individual who is allegedly facing severe physical abuse. The board initially focused on the logistics of the complaint–the fact that it was filed by an out-of-state law firm, that it was not notarized, and that it did not cite the Ethics Code. However, board members shifted their view to the individual’s immediate safety, and passed a motion to send material back to the attorney’s office, the Board of Police Commissioners, and the incarcerated individual themselves about the Ethics Code, filing, and a referral to the Wayne County Prosecutor.

This meeting of the Detroit Reparations Task Force was dominated by a facilitated group discussion of two broad topics: the beauty and accomplishments of the Black community of Detroit, and the harms that have been done to that community, either through deliberate action or as a result of neglect. 

The attendees were given a form to fill out and return, detailing their priorities as it relates to reparations. Representatives of the various subcommittees detailed their work so far and asked for suggestions and input from the attendees to clarify priorities and drive the future of the process. 

Of particular interest to the Task Force and to those in attendance is the disproportionate burden placed on the (mostly Black) citizens of the City of Detroit to pay what some described as exorbitant and predatory drainage fees, while the (mostly white) residents of the suburbs benefit from the infrastructure but do not pay for it.",Detroit,Detroit Reparation Task Force Public Session,2024-06-01 20:17:15.922935+00

I unfortunately hit horrible traffic with a protest downtown, and I accidentally went through the toll which stalled the transit. I left well in advance and am so sorry! I missed the official start time but was only a little bit late. 

Honestly, I note this in my questions/reflections section, but this meeting felt really disappointing. There was very little discussion or enthusiasm from the council members. Attendance was really low, which I make note of in my notes... when I arrived it was just me and two other people. It seems to me that the community is not super aware of these meetings?

This week’s meeting of the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners began with an objection by Commissioner Burton to the previous meeting’s minutes. 

Deputy Police Chief Hayes gave his report and told the Board about the Department’s ongoing crackdown on [drag racers](https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/fatal-drag-race-michigan-silver-lake-state-park-sand-dunes/) and pop-up block parties. 

During public comment Commissioner Burton was implicitly scolded by Commissioner Woods for a comment Woods seemed to think was an attempt to exploit peoples feelings. Just after that, a commenter spoke up and voiced her displeasure with commissioner Burton’s treatment of Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Burton responded by directly accusing the commenter of a crime, and was promptly admonished for his outburst by the chair. 

There was even further conflict when the board moved on to consider the hiring of a candidate for a city position. Commissioner Burton objected again, and intimated foul play by his colleagues, and was again reprimanded by the chair.

The board then went into closed session twice to consider suspending two separate police officers. They voted to suspend them both

 In this meeting of the Detroit Housing Commission, the Commission had questions for representatives of Ginosko Development. Ginosko is in the process of starting to build a modular, prefabricated housing development. In the proposed plan, the housing commission would own 30% of the development and therefore have significant input on how it is run. The developer plans on completing in July 2026, and at that date families can begin moving in.

Several members of the public addressed the commission and detailed how at several buildings around the city, complaints go on, answered or are answered by eviction notices. Residents detailed how buildings are in dangerous disrepair, and that some apartments have become positively unlivable.

Today’s Detroit Bureau of Police Commissioners meeting focused mainly on the incident at the protest of May 19th. 

On that date, Detroit Police Department Lieutenant Brandon Cole was recorded telling a protester to “go back to Mexico“. Police Chief White was in attendance at the meeting to make a report and discuss the incident with commissioners. Chief White made clear his displeasure with the lieutenants actions, reported that he had been suspended with pay, recommended that the board vote to suspend him without pay, and Reported that an investigation had been opened in internal affairs and is ongoing.

I think the contract negotiations lasting 18 months and the safety concerns of operators are worth further coverage.

Blurb:
Public comment took the spotlight at the SMART Board of Directors meeting. While transit enthusiasts praised the new Route 492, their words were overshadowed by operators' anecdotes about death threats, blind spots, being denied time off for their children’s surgeries and hospitalizations, and being told to keep driving in unsafe conditions as long as the bus was running. Operators decried SMART as using “stalling tactics” during their 18 month contract negotiations, disregarding safety, and being unsympathetic to operator needs. Major cuts include pensions for new employees and bonuses. This led to a non-agendaed aside by General Manager Dwight Ferrell, seemingly directed at the operators, where he highlighted what the offered contract contained.

The Board of Directors approved the FY25 budget. A highlight made by CFO Ryan Byrne in the budget was safety, specifically citing a desire to “create a cultural shift.” Byrne did not mention who the cultural shift was aimed towards, since this seemed to be one of the very things operators demanded.

I was also asked a question about Indy Documenters that I wasn't prepared for but answered it to the best of my ability. I appreciate any feedback concerning my responses. This was a great meeting.

12002,"Blurb: The Wayne County Board of Commissioners met smoothly on May 9, 2024, setting an example of what a public meeting could be like for other commissions. The meeting featured Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who presented updates at the Secretary of State and with voting. The commission swiftly voted through budget approvals and resolutions, with the reassurance that all items had been thoroughly vetted in committee. Much of the meeting was reserved for back-patting for old friends. Things took a strange twist at public comment, when two commenters aired a personal battle related to alleged deed fraud. This battle continued in the Zoom chat through the remainder of the meeting, as the Commission did not have Zoom chat off. However, the Commission maintained decorum and did not acknowledge the strange interpersonal war–with some gentle prompting from the chair reminding them not to engage.

11781,"Blurb:
The Board of Police Commissioners voted on a resolution supporting a ceasefire in Gaza and a release of all hostages. This sparked some debate amongst the hardly-quorumed bunch, with Commissioner Bernard suggesting it was the responsibility of the Board to research all companies supported by the department and find out if any are supporting war efforts. Commissioners Woods disagreed, saying it would be unreasonable for the committee to “look for a ghost.” Irreverent comments about a former resolution ensued, with accusing the writer of “playing games.” Bernard called the criticism of his colleague inappropriate. 

The BOPC struggled to maintain their civility as the meeting continued, with Commissioners Burton and Pressley spending extended time bickering and talking over each other over personnel matters.

11762,"Other than the council people who were pretty easily identifiable, they did a pretty bad job of making it clear who was speaking/presenting on behalf on legislation. 

I barely got any of their names and, at the end of each committee meeting, the people would disappear in the blink of an eye. 

This was a big assignment for a first time documenter. I took it because I thought the “bite-size” structure would make it easier to  tackle for the first time.  Each committee was pretty much its own meeting that covered a lot of ground. So I ended up treating each committee like its own meeting. 

Also, there weren’t any tables or places to set up my equipment to type, so I ended up taking most of my notes via hand. Because of this and being unsure how to cover, I ended up spending about 10 hours compiling my notes afterwards. (Thank god for OTTER!) 

Now that I have a better understanding of how to cover meetings (training VS really covering it is vastly different), I don’t think I’m going to have the same trouble moving forward.  

If someone is signing up for their first assignment, I’d steer them clear of any meeting over an hour long or that has so many moving parts. 

Also, after the first meeting, I was utterly lost. Fortunately, I know Sharon Connor. After that first sessions, she graciously sat down with me and went over terminology and procedure. That way I wasn’t swimming in my own questions/lack of understanding during the following sessions and could focus on the content. 

It might be helpful to have a training session on council terms/procedures for anyone who wants to cover them– maybe have a council member there to explain it themselves.",Akron,Akron City Council - Committee Meetings,2024-04-17 15:18:45.284935+00

- The livestream link was only made available to me at 10:45. I joined promptly, and it was clear I missed some of the beginning of the meeting. I wrote 10:30 because that was the scheduled start time.
- I estimate the end time was about 3:15pm. I hit rewind to catch an email address stated towards the end. By the time the rewind caught up, the broadcast had ended. I unfortunately thus missed the end of the meeting it seems, although I barely rewinded. It seems that after some celebratory announcements (about Greek Parade, etc), they must have motioned to adjourn pretty quickly. 

I would check with Maggie (the other Documenter) for outcomes at the end. So sorry for this mishap! I will avoid any rewind, even brief, in the future. I know they will eventually post the video as well soon. 

What was strange:
There was a 4 hour recess/executive session. It honestly, from what I could see attending online, felt like nothing really publicly happened in this meeting. There was no public comment and no debate. It was unclear to me if they passed all of the agenda items presented to the board; items 1-26 were submitted for board approval with the exception of items 14, 25, and 26 which I had Tweeted.

Due to the mishap at the end, hopefully maybe Maggie was able to catch if anything happened at the end in the few minutes right before adjournment.

Dingell was respectable and honorable and knew how to control the Zoom courtroom very well, he was able to address all parties in a timely fashion and didn’t skip a beat. After the proceeding was over he addressed me again by name and asked If I had any questions and explained what he would be doing for the rest of the day which included some adoption finalizations, which he indicated he enjoyed doing. He ended by wishing me a great day and stated the Documenters are always welcome. This was very challenging but I enjoyed it. I tried to write with a level of storytelling where someone in the general public could get an overall idea of what occurred in the proceeding. I also wrote in the names originally and had to replace them with Youth, I think it helped me to write the names first so things would not get lost in translation, plus I did add He and Her or She and Him but I can replace that with the term “Youth” as well.

I think it would be easier for the same documenter to follow the cases they are assigned to because you go in knowing something. As an example starting today was rough but If I were to get another assignment with the same judge and cases I’d be able to follow much easier.",Detroit,Special Assignment — Documenting Juvenile Courts,2024-04-01 18:55:59.377436+00

They had to bring in extra chairs for us, since there were not enough!  Also, when I first tried to open the door, it seemed locked to me. I tried again, turning and pulling harder on it, but still no luck. I was at this point, probably a good 5 minutes late, so maybe that is why they locked it? In any case, finally a lady opened the door for me and I told her I was there to document the meeting, if I could come in. And she let me in and got me the chair because there weren't any. But the meeting was clearly already underway by then, and I felt a tad intrusive. But they were nice and accomodating. But I still felt a bit awkward.

11413,"I am so sorry my thread got broken; I realized I was confused between the two ""add another tweet"" buttons and will make sure I do not make this mistake again.

I think it would be great to maybe update the field guide with instructions on the difference between the blue ""add another tweet"" button and the grey ""add another tweet"" button for dark mode and also in line with Twitter/X updates. On dark mode, those bubble options are either black or grey, so regardless the point to not use the grey bubble make sense. Maybe, a note should just be added clarifying for dark mode that the blue bubble is black. I can send a screenshot of what I mean if it's helpful! 

Given this, I linked to my thread from the last Tweet so that you can read everything. If I link from the first Tweet, the thread is broken. Again, SO sorry for this mistake!

Another point I wanted to clarify regards the attendance number question. Should that number should include everyone present, including the council members? The number I put above, 9, included everybody in the room, including me and the 3 council members. There were very few people at this meeting. It appears to me that not enough people know that these meetings are going on. :/  

An important issue that came up regards the confusion regarding the start time of this meeting. When I woke up this morning, I checked the agenda again and noticed that the start time was written as 10am, not 10:30 as listed for the assignment. I was nonetheless able to get there earlier than 10am successfully. What happened was a miscommunication/typo on the agenda; the Chair ended up apologizing and saying that the meeting time should have been written as 10:30am on the agenda document. Council member Kline seemed a bit frustrated and wanted to start earlier since the time was written as 10am, but the two other members wanted to start at 10:30. I would like to make note of this so that my payment can please be adjusted accordingly for the extra time spent there. 

Lastly, I just wanted to make a general note that this meeting felt very messy. The three council members ended up rather intensely arguing at the end of the session. There was a lot of tension between Chair Perez and Council Member Kline especially. There were some digs on behalf of Perez that member Kline is not reading her emails/attending meetings. It got pretty heated; it was hard to note of this in Live Tweeting because it was clearly some internal beef amongst themselves and how they are working in their roles. Member Kline was also frustrated that the meetings feel too short to adequately talk about things and was mad that a guest presentation had an hour of the meeting time at the January meeting, saying that the meeting should be devoted more to community input instead. It was also rather messy when they were trying to clarify if CPD is required to talk to them or not, almost as if they did not understand the legislation behind their roles correctly.",Chicago,[in person] 2nd Police District Council - Bronzeville/Washington Park/Hyde Park,2024-03-16 18:33:25.488745+00

11397,"Blurb: Council members and residents alike expressed their concerns about the Detroit Land Bank Authority’s Nuisance Abatement Program. Member Mary Waters argued that the DLBA shouldn’t be involved in the business of abatement and asked how the DLBA files lawsuits against property owners when the agency doesn’t have legal power to condemn property or issue blight tickets. Director Tammy Daniels responded saying the Nuisance Abatement actions are under common law on behalf of the city, and the purpose of the program is to advocate for people living next to blighted and vacant properties who might not be able to advocate for themselves. Three out of nine commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the program. One commenter argued the city should end the program, citing they received a Nuisance Abatement for having uncut grass in front of his house—despite the Land Bank claiming they only issue Nuisance Abatements to vacant structures. Another commenter said she doesn’t believe the DLBA has been transparent with her neighbors whom she said have been negatively affected by the program.

The presentations were informative but were delivered quickly from scripts.  (Some of the presenters seemed almost indifferent to the material they were delivering.)  Most of the questions and answers required a fairly good knowledge of the budget and the budgeting process to fully grasp.  The agenda was minimal and was loosely followed at that.  All in all, it was a frustrating meeting for me:  a good deal of information was reviewed and, to some extent, discussed, but it was difficult to follow and record the proceedings given my lack of knowledge.  These meetings should be given to someone who has either covered them in the past or who is able to put in a good bit of prep time learning the roles of the departments and divisions that will be presenting as well as the budget process itself.

OBSERVATIONS/INSIGHTS
1. ZBA convened its meeting in room 1103 rather than in Council chamber because of a scheduled City Council meeting--which didn't take place. 
2. A large number of attendees showed up for at least 2 agenda items--and initially staff let them herd in the corridor outside the meeting room. Later, staff created a cordon in the elevator area.
At first I thought that the board should simply have move the meeting to the Council chamber. But then I thought that technical set-up would probably have
3. I attended only the session for 1132-1140 W Wilson Ave. Due to the large number of objectors, the session went from about 10:15 a.m. to 3 p.m., with a 20-minute break at 1:20 p.m.
4. After the development team & city officials made their joint presentation, the board heard testimony only from objectors. None of the supporters spoke.
5. Shout out to long-time Documenter Susan Carlotta Ellis, who I found sitting next to me at one point. She asked me where the board's decision would appear for public notice; I said I didn't know. Then Susan got up (during a break in the action) and asked Commissioner Esposito the same question. This prompted me to question Esposito more, later (see below).

QUESTIONS/SURPRISES
1. The cityofchicago.org site has 2 ways to find ZBA page(s): 
(a) Government > Boards & Committees > ZBA yields an error page. (b) Government > Planning & Dev't > supplementary info > actual ZBA page.
2. Tho ZBA's ""appearance form"" had many people sign up to speak for and against the development, the board evidently didn't use that. Instead, board chair Brian Sanchez simply asked objectors to queue up by having them raise their hands--and letting them speak with no time limit. When all objectors had finished, Sanchez asked for a show of hands by supporters in the room; 15 remained (many people had left by this time).
3. A room ""proctor"" kept the door locked--so that anyone seeking entrance had to knock and have the proctor let them in. Presumably staff did this due to the huge turn-out for the Wilson Ave. session, not wanting other agenda items disturbed. Does this constitute an OMA violation?
4. Repeatedly during testimony, project opponents asked the board for a continuance, saying they hadn't gotten enough advance notice of the ZBA hearing. Project  chair Sanchez responded by saying, essentially: Stop asking for a continuance, we won't grant it. Seemed to me a pretty clear example of a decision made in advance.

FOLLOW-UP
At the session's end, chair Sanchez said simply, ""The board will take the matter under advisement."" As room's attendees switched to the next agenda item, I asked Commissioner Esposito when the board would vote on the item just reviewed. He said the board would vote on all the items after they'd heard them all. He said the people who remained till the end (which he estimated would come at around 9 p.m.) or who watched the live stream could learn the board's votes. Else, I surmise, one could wait for: (a) news media accounts; (b) the board to release the meeting's recording (I got a helpful tip from India D: There exists a site whereby one can find the recording sooner than when generally released. I don't have that yet.); or (c) a ""Decisions"" link to appear next to the meeting date at chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/zoning_board_of_appeals.html .",Chicago,[in person] Field Trip!

*Disclaimer* I’m not sure if the revenues are from FY 2023 or 2024 

Blurb: District 6 council member Gabriela Santiago-Romero held her second training to understand city budgets. For fiscal year 2024, the city’s revenue is $2.629 billion and general fund revenues are $1.319 billion, funded by taxpayer dollars. Out of all the departments featured in her presentation, DWSD received the highest amount of allocations at $677.14 million, followed by DPD at $388.83 million. The Planning and Development Department received the smallest amount of money, at $6.76 million. Santiago-Romero hopes to obtain more money for the Planning and Development Department, specifically to fund streetscape projects and road diets in Southwest Detroit to limit the number of semi trucks driving through the neighborhood. Other D6 priorities include viaduct lighting, sidewalk repairs, transit accessibility, home repair grants, and air quality improvements. Mayor Mike Duggan’s budget address will take place on March 7th, with budget hearings following shortly after.

Detroit’s Continuum of Care Board of Directors heard public comments from disgruntled board members at its February Board Meeting on Monday. The first half of the meeting went unreported as an incorrect Zoom link was sent to meeting participants in advance of the meeting. Detroit Documenters were able to access the correct meeting link at the end of the Governance Charter presentation.

*Was the charter presentation about updating the Code of Conduct to prohibit sex offenders?*

After a five-minute recess, the board opened up the floor for discussion over the latest Outlier reporting which revealed the latest member Alan Rosetto is a convicted sex offender for the rape of his 13-year-old stepdaughter. Interim Board Chair Candace Morgan never mentioned Rosetto by name (he was present in today’s meeting with his camera off) but did acknowledge that legal counsel has been acquired to investigate the next steps for an “ongoing issue.”

Prior to the discussion, Morgan led a brief presentation titled, “Understanding the Intersections of Homelessness and Criminality” where she explained all homeless residents deserve CoC’s attention, regardless of their personal criminal status. Board Member-At-Large Taura Brown said CoC never engaged in such discussions prior to Rosetto’s hiring - and said it’s possible for the Board to advocate for sex offenders without working alongside them. Youth Homelessness Advocate and Member-At-Large Lydia Goddard said she’s received troubling phone calls relating to this issue over the last month, and it brings her position on the Board into question knowing she’s working alongside a convicted sex offender. She asked for greater transparency into the legal process Morgan referred to and said members would feel more at ease if they knew action was being taken.

Blurb: At Detroit Public School Community District’s first board meeting of the year board members and school officials disagree of the state of food shortages across the district’s 50 schools.

Board President Angelique Peterson-Mayberry said social media is pushing inaccurate representations of the US Foods truck driver strike that resulted in delays getting lunches to DPS schools. In his report, Superintendent Dr. Nikolai Vitti reported 61% of DPSCD students are eating breakfast in schools which 83% are participating in lunch programs. 

Chalkbeat Detroit reported cafeterias running out of certain items while Vitti said he personally visited several schools to ensure  meal services were running at full capacity.

Larger blocks, like chapters may be acceptable, so long as the notes allow any viewer to find the section they are looking for. The true record is the audio, so I think an audio role needs to focus on producing quality recordings and delivering it quickly to assist the notetaker, rather than trying to take detailed notes plus audio.

10650,"Wayne County, Michigan - Our Vending Machines Save Lives

While documenting the Wayne County Commission’s Full Commission on 1/18/2024, the main thing that caused discussion and maybe a few ohhhs and ahhhs was the discussion of 100 Vending machines for all Wayne county communities containing free Narcan, to help save lives during this “opioid epidemic “.
Dr Abdul El-Sayed, Wayne County Health Director, advised the commission, this project “would be the single biggest municipal investment and Narcan access in American history.”
When questioned, about the funding, Dr. El-Sayed advised most of the funding for the next 18 yrs would be from opioid settlement funds.
He also explained some educational opportunities for those utilizing the Narcan.
However, when asked about the placement of these vending machines, by Commissioner Marecki, he never answered and instead started his answer with this
“ Yeah. So let me step back and offer some context”…he discussed most people over dosing are not at home, but never said where the placement would be.
I would assume known places where opioids are being used, but you just can’t assume things in government.
So now one may wonder, is there some compensation for the placement? 
Why not at least say “we are working with communities to determine best placements”.
Dodging this only brings more questions to one’s mind.

Detroit’s Board of Police Commissioners hosted its first meeting of 2024 at the Northwest Activities Center in the city’s 12th District.

Despite the meeting being riddled with technology errors for those live streaming and on Zoom the Board discussed and approved the resignation of Board Secretary Victoria Shah. Shah said the decision did not come lightly and several Commissioners applauded the work she accomplished in her nearly 10-month reign. 

Without much discussion, the Board unanimously approved a series of updates (link to pdf) to the Detroit Police Department’s photo array and lineup processes.

10319,"Whew!  The Board of Police Commissioners could not wait to allow the Chairperson to formally adjourn the meeting! Commissioners were out of their seats before he could finish the motion.  It was a lengthy meeting (over 3 hours) that  included (2) two closed sessions.  While the meeting itself couldn't be described as contentious, it is obvious there are professional/personal conflicts amongst commissioners especially commissioners serving on the policy committee and the personnel and training committee.  Commissioners expressed concerns about the lack of ""working together"" on policies,  untimely notification of committee meetings and a lack of adequate attendance at committee meetings to establish quorums.  Because of these and other problems, when reports/recommendations for actions are presented to the full Board, there are enough concerns and discrepancies raised by committee members to cause the Board to vote to send recommendations and reports for policies, oversight and disciplinary actions back to committees for further discussion and review.  This is especially true when it comes to disciplinary and oversight action against police officers and BOPC staff.  As one commissioner noted, the lack of progressive actions makes the BOPC look inefficient and ineffective.  As the BOPC are elected and appointed officials tasked with overseeing DPD policies and staff, it is apparent this board needs to be more diligent about their oversight responsibilities.",Detroit,Board of Police Commissioners,2023-12-08 03:53:49.055133+00

10298,"The meeting was listed with Documentors.org and the City of Spokane at 1:15pm and on the City of Spokane Website. I came at 20 til and the Security had no idea what or when the meeting was. I asked them to look it up on their website and they didn't know. They called the department more than three different times..I was told first it was at 1;15 down in the City Council chambers, but no one was there, then went back up and they sent me to the City Council meeting room, and there was another meeting in there. I went back up and security called a third time and then they said it was at 4pm and I would have to come back. They told me it would be in City Council chambers..(it was not) it was in the City Council meeting Briefing center...and they offered no agenda nor a list to sign up for public comment. 3 people were at the meeting remotely and one person from Salvation Army and five people who were visitors (including me) who were not introduced or noted for meeting minutes-so I do not know who they were. Two came to provide community reports-Salvation Army who were with HHOS funding recommendations group. The building closes at 5pm and I had to have someone let me out of the building. So I waited from 12:55-1:20 waiting for security to figure out when the meeting was(they couldn't find it on the website) even though I gave them the name Community, Housing, and Human Services Board name..they also wanted a contact person name and phone number( which I did not have) they finally gave me one at 1:20pm and told me to come back at 4. At four I was directed to City Council Chambers and not the briefing room- no agenda was available and when I requested one-they had none available and only finally printed out the first half of the first page. No public comments sheet sign up was available- and they barreled through that super fast. No persons report was available to the public only board members. The announcement by the Salvation Army to the loss of the Trac contract came with some confusing numbers that didn't match up to what she was saying and later she blamed Breann Breggs for not giving them the money from the city..she did this several times- stating confusing timelines, and financial numbers, and blaming others for non compliance of getting recommendation of funding from HHOS.",Spokane,"Community, Housing, and Human Services Board",2023-12-07 04:41:11.932688+00

10194,"11/28/2023 Wayne County Commission Committee on Health and Human Services: The Emergency Procurement process is put into question as several notifications are on the agenda. 



Wayne County Commission’s Committee on Health and Human Services was presented with three emergency procurements on the November 28th agenda. These procurements were during the [health emergency] (https://wdet.org/2023/03/22/wayne-county-juvenile-jail-emergency/) for the Wayne County Juvenile Jail. The first procurement was with [Canfield Equipment] (https://www.canfieldequipment.com/) to retrofit two transport vans to take juveniles to and from the Juvenile Detention Facility (JDF) until the [Criminal Justice Complex] (https://www.waynecounty.com/jail/home.aspx) opens. The second is with [Imperial Dade dba Allied Eagle Supply] (https://www.enichols.com/) to provide janitorial services at JDF. The last was with [Walter F. Stephens Jr, Inc] (https://www.stephenscatalogs.com/) to obtain hygiene items, clothing, and other similar goods for JDF.  

These procurements raised several questions from the committee including: why the purchase of vehicles was required as emergency?, how Walter F. Stephens was chosen without bids or prior work?, and is there process that puts these in front of the committee before they are to completion? In response Dr. Abdul El-Sayed clarified that only the retrofit was part of the procurement process, and that Walter was chosen through recommendations by the Sheriff’s office with whom they share vendors frequently. Suggestions for the emergency procurement process were thrown around including two steps that would require notification to the committee at the start of procurement followed by a final notice with all documents.

This week’s Board of Police Commissioner meeting was postponed one day so commissioners could attend the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement Conference in Chicago. Commissioners. Friday’s meeting was teetering on the edge of a quorum with four members absent. 

The commission addressed a $30 million grant toward highway cameras approved by City Council on Tuesday. Chair QuanTez Pressley said he had no prior knowledge of this motion and hopes the two legislative bodies can better collaborate on such items in the future. Police Chief James White said this grant is a huge step for the Detroit Police Department in its attempt to better police highways. He said the cameras will strictly be used to aid in criminal enforcement such as highway shootings and robberies - and will not be used in traffic enforcement.

During a debate on whether to allow for flexibility around the starting wage of incoming investigators a potential candidate said she would effectively be taking a pay cut if she accepted the job, despite her overwhelming qualifications. The board voted unanimously in disagreement.

City Council failed to pass Gabriela Santiago-Romero’s ceasefire resolution for the fourth week in a row. Before sending the resolution back to committee Council heard from more than 100 public commenters, the majority of whom urged Council to pass the resolution with its current language, anything else would be offensive. Councilmembers Fred Durhal III and Pro Tem James Tate said they would not feel comfortable passing the resolution this week and have been encouraging the language change from “ceasefire” to “humanitarian pause.” Santiago-Romero said if a decision doesn’t come at next week’s final meeting of the year the resolution will die. 

Timing issues might be threatening Council President Mary Sheffield’s property tax reform ordinance, which has been in the works for over two years and would change the property tax assessment process. Many of the public commenters said this ordinance was the first step in correcting the overtaxation of Detroiters. Deputy City Assessor Alvin Horhn said Council is running against the clock - notices must be sent out the first week of January so if any changes are made next week it’ll be literally too late to implement them into the 2024 notices.

She said her office announced information about the meeting in her newsletter, and she will continue to hold more events to discuss the new plans with the community. 

Director Marcell Todd currently believes option 4 is the best redistricting plan, but said he must be objective and open to other opinions. Council president Mary Sheffield said city council will likely vote on the redistricting plans shortly after the council returns from winter recess in January.

Blurb:

Detroit City Council’s Immigration Task Force met for its final quarterly meeting of the year on Thursday to begin coordinating its community engagement efforts for its Strategic Plan. The task force has brought in outside consultant Nourel-Hoda Eidy of Global Detroit Detroit to lead community research and engagement. Starting next week community organizations will be identified for each of the target populations, speakers of Arabic, Spanish French, Bangla, Pashto or Dari and English, to facilitate the spread of surveys which will be used to create focus groups next year. Residents will be compensated $10 for filling out the anonymous survey or for participating in a focus group.

The Task Force is also working with District 6 Councilmember Gabriela Santiago-Romero on the City Council’s ceasefire resolution. Council has taken a neutral stance over the last month as Israel continued its retaliatory assault on Gaza. Kristin Dayag, sitting in for Santiago-Romero, said they plan to have a final draft ready for next Tuesday’s formal session. Dayag said the councilmember’s office is in its second year of petitioning for a secondary street sign honoring Vincent Chin, a victim of Detroit’s anti-Asian hate in 1982. Dayag said despite all paperwork being in order, new ordinance regulations require the honoree to have been a Detroit resident for 10 years, Chin lived in Hamtramck and has been buried in Detroit since his death - and an amendment is being drafted. The sign will be up for consideration in October 2024 when it will likely be one of more than 10 nominated for a handful of slots.

The vendor selection process for the Detroit municipal ID program has been completed and the task force will begin reviewing applicants immediately. The program was put on halt in 2021 after enrolling close to 9,000 residents, only after Santiago-Romero identified a possible data breach with ICE. Dayag said if a safe vendor is not found the RFPs will open again for another round. The original launch date of January is expected to be pushed back, but members didn’t specify for how long. The city is continuing its redistricting conversation after the latest Census data required the COuncil to redraw the city’s district map to better represent the community. Santiago-Romero will be hosting listening sessions in early December to gather insight to bring to community groups. 

Freedom House Detroit CEO Elizabeth Ozorco-Vasquez said their facilities are at capacity, and the unofficial centralized referral process that is being used needs to stop. She said cases are now being handled individually in an attempt to work around the overcrowding, and Freedom House is working with the city and partner facilities to house individuals - but these other facilities do not have all the services needed for migrants such as legal and translation services.

When it comes to legislation the task force members have brought various bills before the state House. While the Driver’s Licenses for All Bill, which would bring back the 2017 program that instated driver licenses for immigrants, is still waiting to be brought before the committee, the Language Access Bill, which would require the state to provide written and oral translation services, is headed to Governor Whitmer’s desk for signing. Additionally, the Newcomer Rental Subsidy Program kicked off last month and provides rental assistance based on immigration status and household size for up to one year.

She will talk to colleagues and members of the Palestinian and Jewish communities to ensure what they put forward will be “supported by the majority,” she said. Audience members chanting phrases like “ceasefire now” and “free Palestine” were asked not to disrupt the meeting by security.
The Michigan Department of Transportation gave a presentation about the I-375 Reconnecting Communities Project.

One commenter argued that MDOT is not and never has been respectful of the Black community. Council member Angela Whitfield-Calloway went on record criticizing the redesign, saying she will not support a nine lane boulevard.

Once again I really enjoyed the learning experience of covering these meetings, which is a big part of what makes this a valuable use of time for me. TBH about actual hours spent, I found myself needing 45 minutes *per department* (vs. 45 minutes total) for pre-research, and I had anticipated three departments (though Board of Elections was done before I started). I spent another 5 hours on the post-meeting writeup despite my effort to organize notes by theme during the meeting and feeling more efficient than last time. I'd attribute this in part due to my desire to get the details complete and accurate, my strong interest in learning as much as I can, unfamiliarity with the departments, and perhaps not being a naturally ""fast"" note taker.

They stated due to the impact of COVID-19 there was a surge in tenant accounts receivable. Through the recertification process, evaluations are occurring to right size the balances. The allowance of doubtful accounts has increased due to deceased tenants, termination from program, and in legal pipeline. Back in 2017, they were collecting 89% but are currently only collecting 67%. There are concerns about whether COVID is still the real reason. 

There was lengthy discussion to understand the recertification process and how DHC is working to close the gap of delinquent certifications. DHC previously contracted with [CVR] (https://www.cvrassociates.com/) to look at past delinquent recertifications and this request was causing long delays and not producing a return on investment. The CVR contract was discontinued.

10/24/2023 Detroit Transportation Corporation Board Meeting: Members of the DTC acknowledged the lack of transparency in their recent meetings and committed to doing better going forward. 

The Detroit Transportation Corporation approved the purchase of six new vehicles to be used in transit patrol. According to what is found on the [Detroit People Mover website under security] (https://www.thepeoplemover.com/security) it states, “DTC Transit Police are sworn police officers with full apprehension and arrest powers”. There is currently a [position posted] (https://www.michigan.gov/mcoles/additional-resources/jobs/mi-law-enforcement/2023/10/04/detroit-transit-police-officer) as of October 4th, 2023 for a Detroit Transit Police Officer. The description states the officers are licensed and are to patrol the transit systems including the city-wide bus routes, DDOT’s facilities and centers, the People Mover, and the M-1 Rail. A community member retweeted during the October 24th meeting “Just me, thinking about how Detroit Transit Police need six new vehicles”. 

[EDSI Consulting] (https://www.edsi.com/) performed a compensation study for the [Detroit Transportation Corporation] (https://www.thepeoplemover.com/about-us/company-profile-mission) and presented the results during the October 24th board meeting. Key findings from the analysis include inaccurate job titles that don’t reflect the scope of the role and a need to reshape the organizational structure to better align those job roles. The study found a need to create more positions to increase capacity within the organization. A few outcomes were creating a pay structure that is transparent and predictable based on market research and implementing pay grades that reward tenure and ensure clear paths forward. New positions were created, and job titles were update to reflect capacity and roles.",Detroit,"DTC, Board of Directors Meeting",2023-10-24 21:33:41.514896+00

The County Commission met in full on Thursday, dedicating almost an hour to member statements in support of fighting escalations in the Middle East. All Commissioners shared feelings of sadness while members Sam Baydoun, Al Haidous, Glenn Anderson, Alisha Bell, Melissa Daub and David Knezck felt compelled to speak in support of a peaceful resolution.

Some discussion arose after Commissioner for District 12 Glenn S. Anderson asked for a breakdown of each city's funding towards lead prevention. The Michigan Medicaid Children’s Health Insurance Program Lead Hazard Control Program was awarded an additional $215,000 to the County Health Fund after _(speaker?)___ said the current programs don’t meet the county’s needs. More than 14.2% of kids under the age of six have elevated blood lead levels. Exposure to lead can come from consuming particles of lead in plumbing and lead-based paints.

The Commission also reappointed Wayne County Airport Authority Board of Director Marvin W. Beatty to his second term after his first year in office ended in a collection of accolades.

I think I covered what was most relevant, but this meeting was very heavy in tax and funding talk that went a little over my head. I kinda got lost in weeds the last 30-45 minutes so the quality of my coverage dipped. Without sounding judgemental Howse was kinda rambling with her questions and I honestly have no idea what she was trying to ask.

Detroit’s City Council met on Thursday to host a long-awaited presentation on the Land Value Tax Plan from CFO Jay Rising. Rising said he wanted to address the concerns about land speculation and highlight how this new plan is directly targeted at increasing incentives for developers while lowering taxes for residents. The issue will not come before Detroiters until November 2024.

One public commentor raised serious concerns with President of the Reparations Labor Union Anita Bell, who is a member-at-large in Council’s Reparations Task Force. The commentor said Bell spent last month’s meeting discussing aliens and other conspiracy theories that took away from the purpose of the meeting. The Reparations Task Force hosted its first meeting in April and has since met four times, with a designated mission to explore to possibility of Detroit implementing community reparations for mass historic unjust treatment of Detroit’s majority Black population through housing and economic development programs. The next meeting is planned for Nov. 4 at ?

You never know when a bus is not going to show up.” They recounted an instance of a gap or absence of bus in which their use of Flex service saved them.

Despite operating its weekly Board of Commissioners meeting without working audio for the majority of its weeks, the Detroit Housing Commission approved Phase I of the redevelopment planned for the Villages at Parkside. Located at the intersection of East Warren Avenue and Conner Street, Villages at Parkside was the city’s first federally funded public housing project when it opened in the 1930s and today consists of more than 250 units dedicated to low-income housing.

Outlier has struggled to answers from Commission members about their role in Villages at Parkside since 2021. The public agency is also a landlord, and purchased the property Parkside resides on last year and then left the buildings to deteriorate without proper maintenance or care. According to the agenda page 16, Phase I of the redevelopment for Villages at Parkside with not include repairs on any of the existing structures, but on a vacant parcel of land on the corner of Connor St. and Frankfort St.

Today’s resolution entered DHC into a grouse lease agreement with Novi-based affordable housing developer Ginosko Development Company to begin pre-construction work immediately on the vacant area designated to be Village 1. According to the agenda page 15, DHC has chosen Ginosko to be the developer for the full Parkside redevelopment project and has plans to enter into a Master Development Agreement over the next year to arrange the specifics of what the revamped Villages at Parkside would entail.

9502,"The issue that should be further covered by local media are the comments about accessibility at bus stops. Several people are complaining about street parking causing accessibility issues at stops. The city has signs indicating it is okay for drivers to park their car, but it is right in front of a bus stop. So cars (and sometimes police) will park in front of stops, then as a bus approaches it isn't able to meet the curb. This is an accessibility issue because the cars block access to the bus for wheelchair users. They need the bus to park right up to the curve so they can get on. One commenter (@ivyrze on Twitter) provided two pictures at the Cass and Warren stop that I've featured in my live-tweet thread as an example. DDOT mentioned trying to address this but I think it's worth following up on, and seeing what other stops experience this type of issue.

Detroit’s Board of Police Commissioners argued the value of sharing the Office of the Chief Investigators Community Impact Reports to the public this week. The reports, which are shared by the Chief Investigator at the start BOPC’s monthly meetings, include the most recent updates on the most extreme OCI cases including active updates of the ongoing investigations. Board Secretary Victoria Shah said these reports have been in place since ____(check minutes)____ and there was no argument when Chairperson Quantez Pressley submitted the monthly agenda for approval at the start of his term. 

Vice Chairperson Jim Holley, who led the meeting in Pressley’s absence, led the debate insisting on how unfair is it to tarnish the name of officers by sharing details of undetermined investigations with the public. Assistant Deputy Charles Fitzgerald, who was sitting in for DPD Chief James White, concurred with Holley’s sentiments expressing it is extremely unprofessional to share such specific details of ongoing investigations. The board agreed to put a pin in the conversation until Pressley returns.

Teaser: Southwest residents prefer bike infrastructure funds go to traffic calming measures instead of additional bike lanes

Blurb: Detroit’s General Services Department presented changes to the Joe Louis Greenway expansion into Southwest in Clark Park on Wednesday. Based on prior feedback from residents, the route has moved from Vernor to West Lafayette and off Fort St to avoid traffic. While some of the bike lanes will be off-street entirely, some will be incorporated into existing streets. 

As another method of capturing public feedback, the department had printed copies of the route map, asking residents to draw or write out their comments. 

Residents were interested in other forms of infrastructure, like traffic calming measures – one person noted that bike lanes are only one part of the picture, and fast-moving traffic can make even protected lanes feel unsafe. The community benefits fund of 1 million Canadian from the Gordie Howe International Bridge project can only be used for bike infrastructure, but GSD representatives will discuss traffic calming as part of safer streets for bikes and pedestrians with the project’s planners. This fund must be spent by March 2025, so decisions will be made this fall – CSD will present at the September District 6 Department of Neighborhoods DONCast, so residents can comment then as well.",Detroit,Joe Louis Greenway Hubbard Farms Community Meeting,2023-09-07 21:36:54.600889+00

Detroit’s Board of Water Commissioners is no longer targeting efforts at its LifeLine Program, as new data shows its fiscal problem lies within higher-income communities. Director Gary Brown said there are 62,000 customers in high-income neighborhoods more than 60 days late on their water bills, all of whom are private citizens, some owing an excess of $5,000 to $10,000. Failures to resolve past due bills can force Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department into a deficit, forcing additional rate increases for all customers. 

Solutions remain the same regardless of financial status, and all customers with past-due bills are highly encouraged to enroll in a payment plan as soon as possible. DWSD Chief Operating Officer Samuel Smalley said plans are individualized to each customer based on needs and income, and said nobody should be in a position where they need to choose which bills to pay.

9/6/2023 SEMCOG Transportation Safety Action Committee meeting: ClearGuide Safety Tool offers geographical data by percent of speeding vehicles, percentile speed and speed limit in 15-minute periods.

Blurb: SEMCOG Safety Action Committee presented on regional traffic crash rates. From 2013 to 2022, rates increased 10.3 crashes per 100M vehicle miles traveled (VMT); fatalities increased 0.06 per 100M VMT; serious injuries decreased 0.28 per 100M VMT.

Relatedly, the Committee invites individuals to request access to ClearGuide Safety Tool. This tool offers time and geographical data by percent of speeding vehicles, percentile speed, and speed limit. SEMCOG has not yet spoken with law enforcement, but Alex Bourgeau, Manager, Modeling & Mobility, said communities’ use of ClearGuide could include police departments.

9281,"While the Documenters Network has no authority over venue or A/V setup in Norcross, it is recommended that future discussions occur with city officials, as to offer constructive criticism from a remote-viewer perspective. Other municipalities offer citizens much more organized viewing methods. The angle of the camera is odd, almost in a surveillance stance, and the view does not adjust for active speakers or display names/titles (either on a desk-plate or virtually) as other live-streams do. If a council member speaks while several have their backs turned to the camera, viewers would have to closely watch body language or read grainy lips to try to tell which person was actually speaking. Adjusting the camera angle would solve this problem. Additionally, the positions of microphones in the room pick up every audience cough, breath, etc., which interferes with the sound quality and audible speakers. This is especially frustrating, given Norcross also doesn't offer closed-captioning or meeting transcripts. I would imagine that if I were a Norcross citizen with a stake in this meeting and could not attend in-person, these A/V obstacles would definitely be frustrating.",Atlanta,Policy Work Session,2023-08-24 00:13:27.369785+00

8646,"When I first entered the Chicago Public Safety building, I couldn't open the door. I clicked the buzzer outside but it didn't work. After a few moments an officer, still talking with someone else, came to open the door. He let me in. However, since I identified myself with Media/City Bureau/ Civic Journalism,  I was asked to sit at a table in the corner next to the other media personnel. The officer needed to confirm media could attend the meeting. I don't know why this was an issue; it is a public meeting. The other journalist was from the Chicago Tribune. Another journalist entered and we were finally permitted to enter. Other, known public commenters had entered, but it seemed like they were cozy with the police and received special treatment. The police did not search my bag or request to see my ID. The room was huge, well-lit, and clean. I sat in the front row, yet I couldn't read the names on the screen for Zoom and understand some of the speakers. Wolff spoke low enough for me to barely hear her. She ran the meeting swiftly, and for the most part, there was little debate. Once the meeting ended some Board members mingled, but some of them were out of the door before me. It was an interesting experience and I think the conversation around Rule 14 was important. Could we follow up on this?

Board member Mary Hoss raised a concern about the ethics of passing a blanket approval for several projects at once just to grandfather them into old requirements before House Bill 2071 passes. I feel like that concern wasn't really given the attention it warranted! 

Also Jim Plummer summarized HB 2071 in such a biased way, and there was a weird energy between him and the board members because they Had to be friendly in a way while also weighing the request he was making.

It was weird because the board regarded him as an expert. When he said these projects were delayed because of financing and nothing else in particular, the board didn't have a lot of pushback although a couple of them said they felt like that couldn't be the whole issue.

Stinson had mentioned he didn't follow the bill proceedings the day before because he heard a more conservative amendment to the bill, which would essentially cut the PFCs' ability to do anything. ""I thought we were done,"" he said, LOL

She stated they already have issues with homeless in the area etc and were concerned with this proposal. NOTE:She also said, and later ,confirmed by Council Member Garry Bredefeld that Huckleberry's provided breakfast for the Council (She said for 30 people) just that morning.

Item 4-A ""Sideshows, Street Races, and Reckless Driving Exhibitions,"" prohibiting the knowing participation as a driver, passenger, or spectator in sideshows, street races, or reckless driving exhibitions. There was concern if there would be ACLU concerns regarding preventing the peaceful assembly of residents, whether innocent people or even witnesses to the event would be ensnared in the 300 feet circle or that drivers in the area would create traffic accidents fleeing the possible misdemeanor charges.Council member Perea said as the crack down on these events in the inner city has forced these events to the edges of the city such as her district.

Others asked PD Chief if he participated in creating this proposal. He said he got it 48 hours prior as well.

I love hybrid meetings and how they include both ""IRL best"" and ""remote best"" people. In this case, Highland Park has one camera trained on the entire council, so you can't see nameplates and there are no onscreen labels. Two of the councilpeople's names I couldn't get. The City's website does not include their photos, and my attempts at quickly googling while documenting only pulled up out-of-date photos of unlabeled groups. I have a plan for next time, but it was frustrating in the moment.

I'll also note that it was occasionally hard to hear. A few speakers seemed to be further from their microphones. Councilwoman Martin would turn around to speak to the Council President behind her with questions sometimes, thus turning away from her microphone. But in the grand scheme of zoom meetings I've been to, most of it was audible and clear. I've definitely encountered far worse.

7227,"Great affordable housing soundbytes in this one.

During the North-Pulaski discussion, they had a good discussion about 3- and 4-bed units. They're really important for housing families, but still very rare. Three commissioners said as much, one saying they'd never even seen 4-bed units in a statutorily affordable development before.

Top level takeaway is, 3 and 4 bed units are more expensive to the point that families that meet the criteria to get considered for affordable housing can't afford the affordable housing products on the market. 

This is utterly egregious. 

Have you ever looked at a tub of Breyers and seen it's labeled as like ""emulsified dairy desert product?""  That's what ""affordable housing"" is. It's a brand name the government can slap on development to sugar coat the modern regime of slum clearance. 

What a great moment!!! Housing Commissioner Novara herself says people can't afford them!!!

And the thing they seemed to be hinting at was ""maybe you'll want to revise you business plan."" Idk maybe not but that was the vibe I got. Which to me means the reason there aren't 3- or 4-bed affordable units on the market is because they don't actually make business sense in the current regime of affordable housing laws, so developers just don't ever build them.

2. There was an interesting bit in here about DPD being more proactive looking for development partners.

7159,"I wrote a whole long rant here, but started plugging in links and it disappeared! I definitely found it hard to prepare and research enough to feel like I knew what was going on in this meeting.  I've been to a lot of city meetings, but more so on housing and neighborhoods, so the water department comes up and I know how residents feel and engage with DWSD, but I've never been to their meetings, so It was hard to follow.  They moved so fast, there were so many documents to review and I just ran out of time.  There were also little to know public comments and that's often my lens for understanding how the body or department affects residents. Looking at reporting and past documenters coverage was helpful.  I feel like all the documenters could get together and create a guide to each body that we document that serves as a primer to the department and how they run meetings, maybe some jargon language to look for, etc.  But also just because people have different knowledge and experience.  One person might know more about procedures and policy and another might know more about community/neighborhood perspective.  I think it would also be good to reach out to the other documented before the meeting to share any pre-research or knowledge, could be done in email or maybe a shared google doc? I also could have spent a long time uploading all their meeting documents, but that would take too much time.

I've met Marilyn from Gardenview personally so it was really educational to document this meeting and understand the process, I only wish it didn't take me so long.

6788,"Hey, I filled this out once and then went to attach my thread, and that deleted my other responses to this form. I don't know if that always happens, but it was not ideal.

This meeting was hacked. Someone was impersonating people on the call via their accounts--various attendees kept getting unmuted and playing sound, way more than normal happenstance. Someone kept unmuting and blasting bhangra music. At one point, two different accounts unmuted and said ""mute mute"" right in a row.

This also extended to the chat--multiple accounts were posting rude things in the chat using similar wording. I think someone had control of normal meeting attendees' accounts. One of the posters was an older man I know from the rail advocacy community. We have attended many of the same meetings and I just can't imagine him posting the f-word in the chat, especially because he was there representing an organization. 

MDOT ejected those that they could and closed the chat. But someone was still drawing lines and hearts on the slideshow somehow. They unshared and then restarted the screenshare and it stopped.

Because of the closed chat and being afraid to unmute people, they had people ask questions and give comment by DMing it to an MDOT staffer. It worked but there was less public comment than you would normally expect as a result.

I felt they did their best to rein in a weird situation. I've never seen a zoom hack that persistent before. And they did share email and a QR code for people to get in touch later. They also repeated the presentation for those who were not able to watch the first time.

This is an odd choice for a meeting to hack--as far as I know there's no controversy to this project, the transportation advocates I know are excited. There are not significant obvious downsides, even to my critical eye. TechTown will lose its longtime parking but that's a pretty niche issue, especially given how many of us TechTown coworking members are now fully or partly remote instead. I also think most people don't know about this new MDOT project. Just an odd meeting to disrupt.",Detroit,Detroit New Center Intermodal Facility (DNCIF) project,2022-11-16 01:25:21.225276+00

6648,"Dear Utilities Committee Chair Councilman Brian Kazy,

I’m Rosie Palfy and I am part of the Cleveland Documenters community. 
 
Cleveland Documenters trains and pays residents like me to watch local government meetings and to make a record of what we see and hear. We launched in October of 2020, and since then we’ve documented more than 570 local government meetings. 
 
Local government meetings in Cleveland fall under Ohio’s open meeting laws. That means there are rules for announcing meetings to the public and rules for how discussions and decisions are recorded and shared. But, we’ve learned from our work as Documenters that making meetings actually accessible for residents often requires more than what is spelled out in the letter of a law.
 
We wanted to share that knowledge with folks who run or participate in local government meetings. That’s you!
 
Follow this link to find our two-page guide called “The Public Meeting Experience.” It has tips and suggestions from Documenters for making meetings more transparent and accessible so that all community members have the opportunity to understand and participate in these vital functions of democracy. Here’s a link to a version you can share: https://bit.ly/CLEpublicmeetings
 
We hope you take a few minutes to review our guide – we worked hard on it.

6527,"Dear Councilman Anthony Hairston,
 
I’m Rosie Palfy and I am part of the Cleveland Documenters community. 
 
Cleveland Documenters trains and pays residents like me to watch local government meetings and to make a record of what we see and hear. We launched in October of 2020, and since then we’ve documented more than 570 local government meetings. 
 
Local government meetings in Cleveland fall under Ohio’s open meeting laws. That means there are rules for announcing meetings to the public and rules for how discussions and decisions are recorded and shared. But, we’ve learned from our work as Documenters that making meetings actually accessible for residents often requires more than what is spelled out in the letter of a law.
 
We wanted to share that knowledge with folks who run or participate in local government meetings. That’s you!
 
Follow this link to find our two-page guide called “The Public Meeting Experience.” It has tips and suggestions from Documenters for making meetings more transparent and accessible so that all community members have the opportunity to understand and participate in these vital functions of democracy. Here’s a link to a version you can share: https://bit.ly/CLEpublicmeetings
 
We hope you take a few minutes to review our guide – we worked hard on it.

6092,"Hm. I think some guidance on where to park, or what bus/train to take to get to city hall would be helpful. I wasn't totally sure how to get there by train/bus, and didn't want to risk being late. Parking was like $14, which, I should have thought of, but didn't. I also think maybe a solid warning that meetings might go longer, like- WAY longer, is probably a good idea. I was prepared for a two hour meeting, but the caucus was still going around 4. I had to scramble to get to work. Maybe suggesting packing some snacks or something? The council members came in and out of the meeting room with cafeteria food and coffee and stuff but I had no idea where to go for that. The seats we were given weren't comfy office chairs, so I think reminding people to take breaks when they need to is important too. I also think reminding folks to have a fully charged laptop/phone is probably important.

Since the meeting was held virtually, it was difficult to really describe the scene because the Board member’s video was not always super clear and because the camera was so far away, it was hard at times to identify who was speaking. There was a link for the agenda on the assignment page but when I clicked on it, it opened up an error message. I could also not find it on the CTA's website. When I put that issues arose during the meeting that should be covered by local media, I was referring to the part of the meeting where the Board was listening to four members of the public opposing the CTA's plan purchase more diesel buses. I understood the President f the Board's reasons to continue with their original plan but then why ask for public comment?

- This was the first meeting in a long time where board members actually let each other share their criticism. Was happy to see they are starting to let each other talk.
- Bryce Huffman from Bridge is working to get the 9 page memo about going to the Inspector General for Commissioner Burton's ""misconduct.""

I haven't been able to find a case that was closely similar to really compare the differences. However, I do know that one council member mentioned the fact that the administration didn't have enough votes for the Hudson site development the first time it was submitted.

5771,The biggest issues were lack of organization across different groups. It did not seem that many alderpeople are actually working together to improve the city. One of the aldermen called out his peers on that. The other big issue is that some of these officials seem to completely disregard the opinion of the public. There were multiple alderpeople pleading for their peers to just listen to what people actually say they need and it just seemed like some of the alderpeople felt like they know better.,Chicago,"Joint Committee: Public Safety; Special Events, Cultural Affairs and Recreation; Education and Child Development; Health and Human Relations",2022-06-24 21:27:28.464191+00

Feedback to better support Documenters' on an assignment like this... this is where I am still new to this and learning.  It looks as if the stats being used for this meeting are not accurate, and I mean way off inaccurate.  Rosie Palify gave light of some CERP data on CDPs website that really contradicts the stats given during the meeting.  Palify was overlooked.  I have not had the chance to do my own fact checking yet.

As far as what I found interesting and want to know more about.  Who are these people sitting on these subcommittees?  Where are they getting their data from?They site 'other data sources' I ask what other data sources. 
 What are the credentials, better yet, real life experience of those who are ""training"" the CIT officers in just 40 hours and why  law enforcement officers?  When  individuals are diagnosed with a mental illness, substance use disorder (which is a mental illness) or both does not automatically make them a criminal.  So why then is it just a handful of volunteer law enforcement officers with 40 hours of ""specialized"" training that are the first and often times the only responders'?

I think I did okay but I'd really appreciate the opportunity to  refine a little. If that's not possible just let me know it's fine I can do it with a copy.

My biggest takeaway is that I feel like identifying public commenters who talk about being bullied, or their kids being bullied, is probably not a good idea. The wrong kid finds out, it’s more ammunition to bully someone over, and possibly retaliatory behaviour.

There were some modifications to the agenda. There were a few last-minute additions (such as the ethics complaint) and when the meeting was running long, some items were moved after the closed session. While I would not describe this as ""wrong,"" it is unusual.

Additionally, while most materials were available in advance, many of the materials related to the Rent Stabilization Work Group were not available on the city's website until this morning.

Apparently, some of these materials were available for persons who were present at the meeting itself. I was able to obtain them from a contact at Southwest Voices and use those until they were added to LIMS. It may be prudent in the future to have contacts at media outlets with in-person attendance to see if we can have them provide those materials to Documenters on a regular basis in the future.

- Christina Kendrick, the staff for the committee, seemed to misunderstand what my role was as a Documenter and referred several times that she was glad I was taking good notes that she could look back on. It is probably worth reaching out to her to clarify the purpose of the Documenters program so there isn't any confusion.

I'm  hoping they will post the video more promptly than they did for the April 6 meeting: that went up on YouTube on April 12, but the March 30 meeting video was posted after a lag of only a few days. Please let me know if this works: I don't figure it would take that long for me to fill in the gaps and drop a few useful references to documents in the notes. It would remove the temptation to sort of spank them for not responding to a request to be provided with the link to their call, but this seems like one of the bodies that needs to be reminded that it's public, not just their private theater kid proceeding.

However, the Board forwarded the matter to the Attorney General’s office to prompt an investigation into what sounded like a conflict between the proper use of office/official position and campaign activities.  They also moved to open an investigation into the “Rose Parks Day” jackets that the Pistons gifted to DDOT employees. Ironically, the Board discussed gifts that were dropped off to city  departments for them to pick up. It was clear that, at minimum, Board staff has accepted gifts without seeking proper guidance and/or a legal opinion prior to doing so.  They mentioned that the media was “noting” their meetings. I also noticed that Board members suggested that they should make certain decisions based on the fact that the media was watching their meetings.

During the online portion of public comment, the first few speakers all advocated for Nicole. When there were 17 speakers left in the que, the board chair said that ""frivilous, repetitive or harassing comments would be dis-allowed"" she further stated that groups should designate on speaker.

This meeting was *heavily* dominated by the facilitation team. This was problematic at numerous points. For instance several participants complained that there was not enough time to discuss. I think this falls on the consultant team running the meetings. This particular team is leaving very little time for discussion, hurrying participants through shallow conversations. Meanwhile their research lead was probably talking for a little less than half the full two hours I was on the call. 

It honestly felt like watching a school group project presentation where one of the kids didn't trust the team to share the work and so did all of it themselves. 

It was to the point where one of the participants, Brianna Lawrence, voiced that she wished there was a space within which to discuss the work more deeply. Romina Castillo, the main facilitator, voiced that this was a recurring theme for the group. But did not state any clear intention to remedy the issue.

I won't say that this is the *wrong* way to do this - since I'm not that deep in it and won't speak on something that's not mine to speak on. But consultants and not participants explicitly holding the whole process and carrying on all of its work might be something to keep and eye on with this Pillar,",Chicago,We Will Chicago: Pod #9,2022-03-01 00:07:27.033164+00

But they shared the presentation in the agenda, so I was able to follow along with that, even though I couldn't see their screens.

I'd love feedback on my notes, since this is my first one. Are they too ""notes-y""? Should I be changing things into complete sentences more, writing paragraphs rather than bullet points?

4222,"Meeting went fairly well. There was a lot of public comment about teachers, principals, the superintendent, not returning calls and emails in a timely manner. There seems to be an active group out of Pittsburgh that wants to buy the old Cooley High campus on Fenkell and Hubbell and call it ""Cooley Village."" There were complaints about not enough PPE in schools, Vitti said there was a warehouse full. Board member, Sherry Gay Dagnogo claims to have employees reaching out to her on social media claiming they are not given wipes or ""Lysol."" Dr. Vitti said Lysol takes 30 minutes to kill the virus alcohol based products kill it on contact. Dagnogo also claimed hot water was not working in schools etc. She seemed at odds with Vitti and the other board members.

4184,"I joined the meeting approx. 25 minutes late, fortunately at the beginning of the first heated debate. I do want to apologize for being late and will hold myself accountable. A few notes: the showdown between Council and Corporation Counsel referenced privileged and confidential correspondence/details on many occasions. It wasn’t clear why Jones’ Invest in Detroit/Procurement proposal would be privileged to the extent that I couldn’t find any correspondence from CC that responded to Jones’ memos. The amendments and her correspondence were available. At almost every city council meeting, there’s a resolution approving legal indemnification/representation. Is that when  Corp Counsel *starts* representing city employees?  When is it decided for officials who are under investigation for waste, fraud and abuse?

It seems like they started the live stream after going through roll call and the reading of the remote meetings ordinance. The Board of Review was out of control and I'm a little confused by Tammy Wendt. I think her vendetta is personal, but that's she's dragging to the surface a lot of relevant disfunction and potential corruption. I want to follow up with Cook County Commissioner Aguillar in Cicero and pitch a story about Amazon's tax breaks, but not sure what publication to pitch to, if you have any recommendations?

Re accessibility - I could not find any live captioning. There was no ASL interpreter (but this seems typical for Detroit). I did not request these, but thought I'd note it. 
The camera streaming was far away from the speakers and it was difficult to see who was speaking. There was no stream in of members attending virtually, so there was absolutely no visual cue as to the speakers when they talked. I emailed the board part way through to ask them to state their names when speaking. Two emailed back and someone said it out loud to the board. They made an effort after that.

Also, it’s not always clear where presenters work or what their titles are. I had to Google some people during the meeting.

I read the entire report, and there is much more to say about it.

2807,Some of the Board members were cutting in and out during the meeting. There seemed to be confusion on how to sufficiently run the meeting on Zoom. The meeting seemed a little chaotic at times.,Detroit,Board of Police Commissioners,2021-03-12 16:35:04.709043+00
2806,"Today’s hearings were much more chaotic than those I reviewed from the 8th, largely due to the 10:00am Committee meeting going over their scheduled time frame. This was actually published a notice regarding the time limit on Committee meeting which allowed 1 hour to allow more time for deliberation in budget hearings. Due to the limited time frame for DEGC  following the late start, council members spent less time discussing their questions or the budget entirely. This also resulted in the reduction of time for public comment. Each commenter was limited to a mere 30 seconds each, and there were 20 total public comments raising their hand for the first meeting (DEGC). The time limit was decided by President Jones & protested by nearly every public commenter. I also noted that President Brenda Jones limited council members to 1 question each due to the limited time frame. She did, however, repeatedly ask more than 1 question herself. She also asked follow up questions after council members asked theirs. This happened several times today. 

Not to be overly critical of Ms. Jones today, but there were question(s*) raised by her that were not an existing issue for others. These include the visibility of council members and whether a quorum was present. This resulted in pausing the hearings to seek parliamentary’s advice on the definition of “present”. This occurred 3 (?) times today and was not addressed by any other member. In fact, two members confirmed that 5 people were visible. 

Overall, the meeting was rushed due to the overlapping meetings. The budget recommendation from city council are all available on the city’s website. The questions/issues section of these recommendations are usually addressed during the hearing. Other topics consistently discussed are the effects COVID has had and will have moving forward, the reasons for change in the budget amount, program highlights & achievements, projects planned for the following year(s). Public comment occurred at the end of each session. The first session had 20 commenters and the last 2 sessions only had 2.",Detroit,"March 11, 2021, Budget Hearing Sessions, 1100am, 1:00pm, 2:00pm, & 3:00pm",2021-03-12 06:59:27.516987+00

I checked the ""issues arose that should be covered by media"" button mainly because of the Census issue. It's interesting that the Census data won't be out until September 30, but that the IL Constitution's redistricting deadlines make that a huge problem.  It's a continuing story, but something that's just now beginning, since the Board of Elections was so recently notified that the Census data wouldn't be out until September 30. 

I did some research after tweeting the meeting, since that part of the meeting flew and I found it hard to wrap my brain around all of the dates they were bandying about.  According to Article 4, Section 3 of the IL constitution (https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con4.htm), if there's no redistricting plan approved by June 30, then they have to appoint a bipartisan redistricting commission by July 10, and file a redistricting plan by August 10.  

With September 30 being when they expect us to have Census results, it looks like either the General Assembly (before June 30) or this commission (by August 10) will have to draw a redistricting plan...without this updated Census data.

Constitutionally, this plan has to be approved and filed by October 5 -- which is after the expected date of the census data, but still, doesn't leave enough time between that release and its mandated filing date to allow for a redistricting plan informed by updated census data.",Chicago,Board of Elections,2021-02-17 18:29:30.853024+00

I should have noticed the big ""This meeting will be held via teleconference"" at the top of the agenda and went to that first, instead of a video stream. It might be helpful to point out in future assignments that Documenters should note whether teleconference or livestreaming is going to be the preferred method. 

On this particular meeting, only the last 8-9 minutes of video made it to YouTube. 

Teleconferencing made it difficult to know who was talking when, so that aspect of the note taking is poor. I did review the video and was able to do some attribution.

Thank you for the reminders to look once more at the board's website before the call -- they'd added a packet of info that I probably wouldn't have noticed without that reminder.

2169,"**Note - Budget meeting started at 1 pm and went immediately into recess until 2:33 pm. 

I decided not to tweet @CityCouncilDet, but I know that a lot of people complain about how long it takes City Council to make decisions. I thought that it was an inefficient use of time and a disservice to the public for the Budget Committee Meeting to have to wait for the Internal Standing Committee Meeting to end before it started. They rushed through the agenda and moved a lot of items to January sessions. I saw that they checked in at 1 pm, and then went back to broadcasting IOS since there was not a quorum. 
 I know that virtual meetings are relatively new, but you would think they would have a system in place for running two committees at a time or if one committee runs long and into the time slot of another.  While waiting for the Budget meeting to start, I did tweet that they could have two zoom channels. Or maybe since they also have the meeting live streaming on their website Channel 10, they could show one meeting there and a different one on Zoom, or something. 
I'll also note Detroit City Council has been criticized about transparency and asked for clarity on their websites on several occasions that I've noticed just during documenting assignments alone.

1959,"I had looked at the agenda last night on the CCC website, but when I started today's meeting I just opened up the one provided on the documenter's website. Since the agendas are very similar I didn't notice till we got to the actual reports that the documenter's one posted was from last months meeting. 

After the initial reports, many of the items discussed are quickly introduced and then approved. I was not sure how much of this had to be documented in the live tweet so I mostly listed the items with a short description either provided in the agenda or paraphrased from the person presenting. 

they moved into a closed session around 4:00 pm and then adjourned around 4:40 I wasn't sure what time to post, but will just put 4 pm for now.",Chicago,Board of Trustees,2020-10-01 21:34:41.329652+00

1940,"Just wanted to leave a few notes about the meeting. One: they technically didn’t have at public “speakers.” They had people write in comments, and the legal counsel read them to the board. Idk if that’s an OMA violation, but I think it should be! Something’s lost, in my opinion, when people aren’t allowed to physically speak their comments into the public record. 

Two: For the last 20 minutes or so, the board was operating off of an agenda that I was unable to find. I accessed the agenda off of legistar, but several of the items the Board brought to the floor were ones I didn’t see on the agenda. It’s possible I wasn’t able to find the most up-to-date agenda, but I’d still argue they need to make it more accessible.",Chicago,Board of Commissioners,2020-09-25 19:36:52.038156+00

1922,There were some tech issues with the meting which made some parts hard to follow.  The commissioners even relogged in to try and solve the problem  It all worked out though.  This meeting had two ordinance change debates that should be followed up on.  One was is an ethics ordinance and the other has to do with selling compost and using it projects done by the district. There was some debate as to why the City of Chicago wasn't using the MWRD EQ Compost.  Some of the board members are also up for re-election.  I need to educate myself about the terms lengths and elections regarding MWRD Commissioners.  Ive contacted two commissioners before the meeting but didn't get anything useful to share.  Is there a way to pause the meetings or record them?  Wondering what tools people are using that could help.  Much to learn.

I felt that the organizer/non participant to participant ratio was a little awkward, especially cus of the racial make up of those two groups, but the Bronzeville residents and members of GKMC who came out were really generous with their ideas and personal stories, and I’m curious to know how they felt about being in a fish bowl sort of situation, or if they knew it would be like that.

We met near a cluster of stores located near the train station at 51st and Calumet called Boombox they are  pop-up storefronts constructed from an upcycled shipping container.

1789,"Nothing more was needed. Commission members lack connections--as they say--so it seemed they were releasing the agency of any feeling of responsibility or self-advocacy for inspections, putting the onus on /schools/ and communities to self-report IEPA issues.

It was really helpful that I covered the school board meeting last week that discussed this plan in depth so I was a lot more prepared for how fast everything moved. I had a few technical issues at the beginning of the meeting (my computer slowed down considerably once the zoom meeting started) so I ended up doing most of the tweeting from my phone, but once I got passed that things moved smoothly. I wonder if there is some sort of training module that can be done to focus more on live-tweeting though.

When I called in at first, it said 3 people on the call. I called in later around 4:30pm, and there were 60 people on the call.

If that is the document provided on legistar, it is rather inadequate.  She also said she submitted a supplement, but I could not find that anywhere.  Also, there was no agenda, and no provision for public participation.  The County Board should also try to improve its virtual meeting setup.  There was no easy way to see all the participants.  Some, such as the budget director (Annette Guzman) and the Public Defender's Chief of Staff (Lester Finkle), could be heard but not seen. At a minimum, the participants should be seen and identified by captions.  I checked that the meeting did in some ways go better than expected.  That is because Amy Campanelli is actually relatively easy to follow, though difficult to write up because she squeezes an awful lot in in a short period of time.

I listed out all of the motions voted on in my notes which took quite a bit of time though, something I would not have been able to do if I was live tweeting. When you are doing the live tweeting how do you determine which of these items is worth including or not when they take up sometimes just a few seconds of the meeting? I also had to transcribe a bunch of items listed under ""Vote on Executive Session"" items that were not listed in the agenda.  I wasn't sure if this was necessary or not for the notes, but wanted to include just in case.

I was only able to catch the budget hearing for the Sheriff's Office. I checked the Board of Commissioner's social media accounts, which listed the budget hearing schedule. The schedule said that it was subject to change. I assume that the board started and completed the three other budget hearings well ahead of the scheduled time of 12:30pm. My guess is that they kept going through the hearings after completing the morning's hearings, which started at 10:00am.

This meeting was longer for me than expected. There were a lot of people that scheduled for public comment, and I believe some did not have the chance to speak.

My internet connection also went down like twice, which I noted on my Twitter thread.

All the items presented could be stories, and I did live-tweet that two- the puppy mills and flavored cigarettes articles were published during the meeting.",Chicago,Committee on Health and Human Relations,2020-07-07 00:36:08.03755+00

1677,"This was the first meeting of IDPH's Diversity in Health Care Task Force. Therefore, it should be covered by the local state media. As a chair of the task force was named Prashka,

Also, they did state the names of the members during roll call, but some of the names were butchered so that is the reason I did not put them on my Twitter Thread, and I could not find them on IDPH's directory (perhaps because the task force is new). 

Also, there 21 participants at the beginning, but at the end 19, But, since there were 14 members and about 4 other officials/administratives. I believe only myself and about 3 other people were present that is why I put 4 people in attendance. 

The other quarterly meeting and working group members are pending, so this should be made aware for the next meeting.

During the meeting, they went through 3 cases of police misconduct but sped through the details and did not discuss the cases at all so we (the public) were left with no background information. 

Also, I put 20 as the number of attendees but that was just a guess. There were more people on the call that didn't speak and I could not see how many people were present",Chicago,Police Board,2020-06-20 05:36:30.279437+00
1659,"This was a very well-led and organized meeting, especially considering the difficulty of conducting a remote meeting.  It was also gratifying to see how strongly some of the commissioners are concerned about the environment.

1653,"This assignment was difficult partly because of the usual challenges with full City Council meetings, namely the lack of debate and the assumption that participants know the details of the important agenda items and so they do not require much explaining.  But it was also difficult because there were an appalling number of technical glitches in the livestreaming of the meaning.  The livestream froze so often, and the presentation was so intermittent that at times it was impossible to follow, especially when they had technical discussions over procedure.  It is possible that the OMA was violated.  Mayor Lightfoot's ""stopgap measure for eviction protections"" did not receive a link on the agenda and did not even get an item number.  So there was no apparent way to obtain the actual text of her proposed ordinance. There is a document item #02020-3501 that might be the ordinance in question, but this is very far from obvious in the meeting agenda.  John Byrne of the Tribune obviously had a copy, but I assume that is because of his actual connections with City Council members and staff.",Chicago,City Council,2020-06-19 00:09:02.149868+00

1648,"This was the 3rd or 4th note-taking assignment I have had, and it was unlike the other meetings i've taken notes on in regards to its scale and volume. It had up to 20 items to discuss, and a good number of them were large projects (condos, 200+ unit buildings, etc.)  with years-long negotiations and lots of moving parts to them. About 16 people were on the call presenting and talking about their items (not counting all of the aldermen). I was surprised at how overwhelmed it was. I want to be able to take notes more succinctly and efficiently in the future to be able to make the deadlines. I apologize for the delay and wanted to give you perspective on why I may have taken this long. Especially because this is such an important meeting in regards to the future of this city's working people.  If you have any advice at all for how *you* choose what is and isn't important to take note of --specifically for the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards meetings, I would really appreciate it! 

As for feedback for City Bureau, I have found that looking at past notes from other Documenters on the same meeting was very helpful in anticipating the topics discussed and how to organize the notes. Playing the video on my phone while typing on my laptop was the best way to follow along. My phone has better volume and you can skip forward or backwards easily.

I feel like this took me a lot longer to complete than anticipated, but I'm hoping I will get better at note taking as I do more of these. I also learned that I should go even more in depth with certain agenda items since some items were a quick yes or no vote so I had to do research after the meeting to make sure I understood what was being approved. It was helpful that the live stream was uploaded immediately for reference, but it was difficult to get a sense for who was present at the meeting due to limitations of zoom and not actually seeing who was ""in the room.""

1525,"I am not sure how many people were in the audience since there was no viewer number. But, probably the people that submitted public comment, so maybe 50-150?

I was not really able to some of the commissioners sometimes or staff members.

The items presented at the beginning like the COVID-19 Property tax relief, transfer amount of $50,00, and 20-2378: A resolution to share addresses for emergencies (safe) with first responders seemed like the most important resolutions passed today.

Another item, which I thought was interesting was the lack of paper to print out birth certificates and death records. I think there is a story here.

Also, I am not sure if the board went over all the items on the agenda. I think they missed 41 items...?

1517,"The live stream was interrupted throughout the meeting.

I wish there were slides shown on the screen for some of the projects that they were discussing so the public can see what area they were talking about. 

I think local media should cover the three lawsuits against Emmett apartments more, and this would be discussed at the City Council meeting.

Surprised at how well/smoothly the Zoom meeting ran, but curious about how ""open"" this form of discussion was, since most of the questions Ald. King addressed (at least 20 of 27) were preselected from prior emails, and the discussion felt very controlled and focused on the presentation's talking points, versus community concerns usually displayed at Community Engagement meetings.
Note - I said 650 participants, but it was probably more, since the 650 number is just the preregistered participants, and they were at capacity and had to stream via Facebook Live and Youtube.

This was a video conference with call-in features, so most of the committee were visible. In terms of # of people present, I chose 5, because I saw other folks connected to the meeting that didn't appear to be participating.

Everything on the agenda was rubber stamped.

Two ideas that arose from this meeting are: 
1) the data/resources for African American pregnant women with covid19, and postpartum; and 2) if African American men are wearing masks? (Social issues behind this)

1391,"At the start the Board asked whether there was anyone other than commissioners on the call and I hesitated to state that I was and that I was with City Bureau/Documenters. Other members of the public did not address themselves and the only person who did, did so to express that they were invited to the call. Do Documenters have an obligation--even a professional one--to announce themselves and state that there is media present?

A separate issue I observed was that commissioners would talk over each other and so it can sometimes be difficult to understand where a train of thought is going. There was also an incident where one of the commissioners was booted/removed from the call, seemingly due to technical issues. These kinds of interruptions/inaccessibilities I would say are important to document and a reminder of how important it is to make sure that when attending gatherings remotely that Documenters' tools and assistive tech be set up to work properly. I'd recommend people attend these calls at least 10-15 minutes early to ensure they have time to work out any kinks.",Chicago,Board of Health Meeting,2020-04-15 15:28:52.803309+00

Although it was listed as a meeting that would speak about the issues in Black communities and how they are being affected by COVID-19, it can be said that less than half of the meeting addressed this issue.

I had hoped the meeting link would be available well in advance, but the board may not have been able to post the link beforehand. I just refreshed the CCC YouTube account page at about 2:01pm, at which time the live meeting video appeared.

It makes me wonder if they speak in a deliberately arcane manner so that the public will not figure out exactly what they are doing.  But maybe I am starting to get too cynical.

We were finally lead back when I mentioned concerns about open meeting laws. There was a member of the public who was clearly well known by the CCHA (he talked to both of us for most of the hour regarding his challenges with housing vouchers and alleged assault by office staff) who was hoping to make public comments during the allotted time. When we were finally lead into the room, they were apologetic and did allow for additional public comment even though that portion of the meeting had passed. However, the officials were notably dismissive of this member of the public (although one person did offer to meet with him one-on-one following the meeting). It's difficult for me to assess some of the check-box questions re: following the stated agenda as we missed most of the meeting. It was also difficult to hear some of the speakers.

It was a good way to learn a little about how the MWRD operates, on how ties are forged and maintained between MWRD and local officials and how they form partnerships with local municipalities.

The commissioners actually responded to public comments, seemed to be in no hurry at all, and didn’t seem to intentionally obscure anything. My main question going into this was whether or not commissioners would bring up affordable housing, and they did every single agenda item. Also, on a nerdy level, I kind of love talking about architecture and design, and even though i have different taste than Maurice Cox, I loved hearing him talk about architecture.

However, other things did have more substantive discussion -- for example, the quality plan for Provident Hospital.

There was a significant period (about 40 minutes) that the Quality and Patient Safety meeting went into closed session.  It was noted on the agenda that they would be going into closed session for a time, and broad headings about what they would be discussing were noted in the agenda.  The meeting cited the legal parameters allowing closed session, and it's understandable that a patient safety committee would have to go into closed session due to HIPAA concerns.  I, of course, cannot verify what they discussed in closed session, but it at least passes a common-sense test that this committee would have matters to discuss that legally fit under closed session provisions.",Chicago,Finance + Quality & Patient Safety Committees,2020-02-21 00:15:27.722574+00

One other thing...usually city council is pretty audible. This meeting had a lot of alderman talking amongst themselves while officials or members of the public were speaking. At times it was a legitimate distraction from what was being said officially.

So identifying folks was a bit difficult— and not introduced (and the permanent commissioner name plates on the desks were of course not the correct people either).

1262,"As for my marking that there was an issue that should be covered by the media...perhaps.  At one point, during the discussion of the proposal to allow for owners of multiple taxi medallions to renew the ones in good standing if they have had one or more revoked, members of the committee began to discuss the phenomenon of unlicensed chauffeurs driving taxis -- for example, a licensed chauffeur letting their buddy drive a taxicab.  One of the members of the committee suggested that he had, anecdotally speaking, come to believe there was a rise in unlicensed chauffeurs driving taxicabs with medallions.  The chairperson of the committee stated that it was worth doing research on that -- so, I'm not sure whether it's time to actually do coverage on that, since I'm not sure when they'll actually do research or how a non-city-council organisation would be able to do that research well enough (as in, how prevalent it is now, and even comparing it to how prevalent it was before...) to report it with honesty.  but, if that is going on (or going on more often), it's worth at least following when they do the research, or even considering independently if that is a research project for which we could reliably collect data.

Aside from that, there were a few things that made the meeting tough to follow.  The members of the committee face out to the people there (good!), but don't have nameplates.  I get that different committees use the room, but it makes it tough to follow who's saying what without there being at least portable nameplates.  And, more substantively, it really did feel like they knew what was going on and had figured out that they were okay with everyone in advance.  Most notably, when passing the rule allowing earlier opening of taverns -- the councilperson who brought that up told the anecdote about wanting to be open for European soccer games, or have an extra group of tables for mimosa brunch -- but didn't actually say *what time the bars would be allowed to open* before the provision was passed, and that information was not on the agenda sheet given to the public, either.",Chicago,Committee on License and Consumer Protection,2020-02-13 18:53:40.386204+00

But, it very much felt like everything had been discussed in advance, likely in subcommittee meetings.  There was a 65-page main agenda plus five separate late-addition documents and two pieces of issued errata, and most of the meeting was a rapid-fire sequence of calling items in the agenda to be voted on (sometimes in bulk) and voice votes on each.  There were a few pieces for which people came up to speak (the Transportation superintendent, the medical examiner), but even then it felt like these had all been discussed and decided elsewhere.  This meeting felt like pro forma approval of a litany of foregone conclusions.  Cook County does have posted meetings of the separate committees -- and obviously City Bureau should cover both those and the Board of Commissioners at large.

They only discussed one of those agenda items, in which the leasee is an organic farm. I don't know who the others are. If that happens again in the future, should I call ahead and ask? 

There's actually a bunch of questions I want to ask them, do you guys find that emailing or calling ahead is best, or trying to ask them before/after the public meetings? I'm particularly interested in who they lease land to, as well as their sewer tax. Thanks!",Chicago,Board of Commissioners,2020-01-09 18:22:51.106755+00

1151,"This was a very challenging meeting because it zipped through complex issues quickly.  There were several handouts, although one of them (the most important one) I did not get until the end of the meeting because they had not brought copies in yet at the time I took my seat.  The Budget Book, which is pages, was not available to the public until after the meeting online.  A ""Budget Guide"" they referred to I have never been able to locate.  As City Bureau reported, MWRD has great transparency.  This meeting is on video and is easier to follow there than at the meeting, because you can see who is talking, and the presentation slides are easier to see than they were in the gallery.  This meeting was very interesting, but much easier to follow on video with the Budget Book (the Executive Director's recommendations) available for reference.  Both as I followed along and as I wrote it up, I was thinking that it would be a really good idea to have a City Bureau Public Newsroom (or 2 or 3 or 4) on budgeting, if there haven't been already. ... Also, there was no real opportunity for the public to participate in this meeting, since they scheduled a Public Hearing on the Budget December 5 (did City Bureau cover it?).",Chicago,Special Meeting: Departmental Budget Presentations,2020-01-03 02:42:41.550217+00

1046,"Two things stood out to me from this meeting that should definitely be looked into be local media. The first is looking into item #4, requesting the authorization not to exceed $1.5 million into the development of Ogden Commons. It was expressed during the meeting that they hope to use the opportunity zone tax, “We are negotiating the agreement we’ll maintain an 8% equity state and will be part of the opportunity zone tax law. So it’s a 10 year equity fund.” Gurgon said.
In the work I have done in Puerto Rico on property rights, I have found that these ""opportunity zones tax breaks"" never work on behalf of low-income communities, instead they are a tool for gentrification. Not to mention, the tax cuts won't benefit the community, but they may use CHA funds since this would be a joint venture between CHA and Habitat Company.

The second item I highly encourage someone to look into is item #15 which is the authorization for a loan requested by chief financial officer Ann McKenzie. The building she is requesting the loan for is located on N. Armitage on Milwaukee Ave. This building did not have CHA unites, and McKenzie argues that this is
""an opportunity for 47 unites in an area where we did not previously have units.” The opportunity would be for those unites to be a part of the voucher program.--This voucher program in and of itself has become controversial. The voucher program is different from the public housing program.-- The problem with giving the loan is this money, as McKenzie pointed out, is from HUD specifically for rehabilitation. Which is all fine and good, but why use it for a loan for a new building when so many residents came to complain about the deplorable conditions of their own buildings which have not been rehabilitated? It seems like a legal loophole to give corporate property management companies HUD-backed loans, with low-interest to make these mixed income buildings. Meanwhile, in order for low-income residents to apply for one of these 47 units, they must join a separate waitlist, public housing or section 8 vouchers cannot be transferred to the mixed income vouchers. It is worth looking into!

1017,"I believe the whole issue with the #ADOS group would make an interesting story. There is also not a great deal of trustworthy information available regarding this group so a story from a reputable news organization would be useful for future events involving them. 

I marked above that a possible Open Meetings Act may have occurred only because not enough time was allotted for all those who wished to give public comment to speak, granted there were many (40-50). I'm just not entirely sure if it mandatory that everyone be given the opportunity to speak. I also thought it strange that council members in the audience were allowed time to ask questions before public comment and given a good amount of time to do so.

From recess conversation:

Discussion Comparing PE to Previous Recession-Era REIT Sector Exposure 

The Board now takes a five minute break, during which City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin speaks informally with Lorna Scott regarding the asset management companies BlackRock and William Black, presumably hired by the fund. There is some confusion regarding approval to raise further cash either drawing from these funds or fulfilling and bolstering scheduled transfer agreements? Unclear. Conyear-Ervin asks “Did we approve them?”
Conyear-Ervin then shifts to the topic of the City Group Real Estate Company, which used to manage the Real Estate portion of the fund. This fund has apparently under performed, especially during the past recession. Calahan acknowledges that “unfortunately, the Fund had to suffer” She draws a parallel with this REIT fund against the proposed private equity scheme RFP and expresses concern regarding flexibility of fund length scheduling and liquidity restrictions through both mechanisms. Loses on the 2007 investment are still dragging on. The representative from Calahan is determined to quell the concerns of Conyear-Ervin. He disagrees with her comparison and he goes on to praise the upside of expanding the fund’s private equity position through a new RFP. He states, ‘No, the idea is not to repeat that.”  The CIO backs his claims.

Conyear-Ervin returns to the topic of the fund’s real estate holdings and directs the attention to as many people at the board table as possible – it doesn’t seem that they’ve returned from the “break.” It appears that the fund’s current “Limited investment partnership in real estate” is now managed by Apollo’s Global Real Estate Management division. City Group was removed some time ago and the Calahan rep reiterates that “Assets were invested at the peak of the property market, and we suffered after that decision.” She firmly addresses the board and the CIO, “I don’t want us put at risk again.” Scott concurs that the decision will have to hold against shifts in the market --  “We are going to be locked in.” But she’s confident that market conditions and forecasts support a shift into PE for the fund.

Therefore, collecting more community responses/comments/ suggestions on what they see is wrong that supposedly CPD should be improving. The subject being discussed was really important and I feel like I missed important observations said by other community members because I wasn't able to move around table to table. 

As well, Deputy Monitor James Codren came up to me after the meeting and said he was open to us inviting them to City Bureau for any sort of discussion.

890,"On the positive side, the meeting was run very efficiently.  The 176-page packet made available to the public is very helpful and informative.  I met with Patrick Thomas of the Office of Public Affairs.  He was very helpful and accessible.  His email address is patrick.thomas@mwrd.org.  The sound system was not that great.  A few speakers, especially John Murray, was difficult to hear.  I think the complaint Mike Archey had about the waste of taxpayer dollars at the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant by Metropolitan Biosolids Mgt is worth following up.  His email address is mdarchey@mdarcheyllc.com.  I do think that the Documenters program ought to find out more about MWRD committee meetings. Or maybe the program knows all about them?  In any case, I wonder why they are mostly closed to the public, or why they don't have meetings at all.

Mr. Archey and his partner said privately that he believed that Mr. Murray was “a good guy,” something he would not say about all staff at MWRD, but that somewhere down below him, staff members were misinterpreting their own data. To stress the general level of incompetence, he told me a story of how he had requested information through FOIA. MWRD responded by offering to send him the relevant information by fax. Archey’s fax was unavailable at the time, and requested they send it to him by email. They said they couldn’t, so they Fed’exed it to him. He showed me the envelop. It cost $25.50 to send him two pages that conveyed nothing except referred him to the relevant links on MWRD’s website.",Chicago,Board of Commissioners,2019-09-20 17:44:10.828459+00

The alderman asked good questions about the lack of transparency however, the panel of four people (with no name disclosed in front of them) seem very guarding, responding with the same statements over and over. Saying that they need to ”defend the City of Chicago from potential litigations”. So I left with the question as to why this Ethics Committee exists? Also, the only public comment was from a black male who seems to have mental issues, so why is he allowed to participate? Very weird situation. One could feel the stress in the room.
At the end of the meeting, the guards turned off the lights in the back of the meeting room (where the attendees were sitting) and all the government officials stayed talking to each other. They asked us to leave.
At the meeting, few aldermen participated but most look absent and not interested in what was being discussed.

ALL of the Alderman had significant conversation and questions regarding the amendment to the 2019 Annual Appropriation Ordinance (basically spending the budget) for changes affecting the remaining 4 months of 2019

CB should definitely provide followup reporting on the childcare RFP released from Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) on the RFP process, the technical glitches they and OMB deny and the de-funding of small and medium-sized neighborhood early childhood education organizations beyond 11/30/2019. Every alderman requested to be put on the list to have a wide-ranging discussion with the commissioner of DFSS, Lisa Morrison Butler on the extreme impact defunding will have on low-income families in black and brown neighborhoods since a majority of funds will go to Chicago Public schools, which doesn't have programs in place for care beyond 3:45. Working families rely on childcare through 7P.    

A place to start is with Little Angels Learning Center in Englewood, who spoke during the Public comment section. 

The meeting was full of opportunities for additional reporting based on the funding changes for the last 4 months of 2019.  

Areas I recommend for focus are:

:: Southside Early Diversion Program--65K to Chicago Police Department from Cook  County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS). The problem? How are some districts on the south side excluded from this funding?
:: Overdose Data to Action Program--$3.3M to Chicago Department of Public Health (DPH). Who's collecting the data, how is it being used? What are the outcomes? The potential problem? CPD's use and collection.
:: Abandoned Residential Property Municipality Relief Fund--$2.2M to the Department of Housing from Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) to reimburse the Department of Buildings for demolition, property preservation, and vacant lot cleanup.

817,"The meetings are a little oddly ordered -- it's written in the agenda, but it feels a little strange when enacted.  They start with resolutions, but some resolutions are just congratulations or recognitions, and others are substantive.  For example, there were resolutions today that recognised milestones, but another resolution that set a schedule for a long-term project that would possibly require eminent domain powers to be invoked.

Then, there's a recess.  Then, they meet as the ""Committee of the Whole"".  At that point, they go through and each commissioner mentions which item or items on the agenda they have questions about, and they go through and each commissioner brings up their questions or starts their discussions about whatever items on the agenda they want to address.

Then, they recess again.  And, when they reconvene as the ""Board of Commissioners"", they vote on things.  Specific items that are set aside during the ""Committee of the Whole"" part can be voted on, on their own.  But, most of the agenda ends up being voted as part of the ""Consent Agenda"", in a batch.

The good news is, each of those items in the agenda are published in the LegiStar page, there for public review before the meeting, so people can come and comment if they'd like.  Though, there are so many contracts and plans and financial items on the ""Consent Agenda"" that to does seem like they're already in the middle of something, like they've already decided that these projects are going to go on or take more money or so on -- hence, my opinions above that something felt strange or wrong, and that it seems like certain decisions have already been made before the meeting.

As for the meeting logistics?  They do some things so right.  I love that they have screens on either side of the room that show what item on the agenda is being discussed.  I also love that, when you arrive, a person is handing out agendas, and you have a choice between the short-form one (the ten-pager) as well as the book-length agenda with all the document attachments for each item available.  Having the full 200+ page document there makes it a lot easier to follow the meeting and make sure I'm not completely mischaracterizing the issues as I tweet about the meeting.

The one thing that gets my goat about the setup of the room is how they're seated.  Instead of the board facing the public and the board's staff off to the side or just facing the board, the board's closest staff is at the front facing the public, and the board itself sits at tables in chairs with their backs to the public.  That makes the meeting a little harder to follow than most meetings.

And the ""last straw"" comment that got her kicked out was a short, seemingly good-natured joke she made while someone was at the podium speaking; it wasn't like she was shouting out offensive things to purposely disrupt the meeting, or making it difficult for others to hear.

Noteworthy issues during the meeting that might be of interest: They discussed new laws passed by Gretchen Whitmer regarding Civil Forfeiture, which is where the police can take your stuff (often your car) if you're accused of a crime. Now you have to also be convicted, but it sounded like they may take the stuff and hold onto it while folks are going through the legal process, thus depriving families of much needed transportation during that time. That could end up costing someone a job. It sounds like they expect forfeitures to fall 10-40% under the new law, but it's unclear how much.

Additionally, apparently there's a large scale internal investigation of the DPD Narcotics Division due to corruption. Chief Craig tried to make it sound like everything is already handled, but I'm curious how bad things are for them to seize all 50 of the computers from that division and have them forensically examined.

Although there was a mic passed around, sometimes it was hard to discern names or hear complete sentences. There were 2 documenters, 1 member of the public and 1 committee member sitting in the public area.
I wouldn't say an 'issue' arose, but there are opportunities for the Fellowship journalists to follow up on the Equity in Cook County Report when it is approved by the Board as well as the Cook County Invests program.
Lastly, a reporting angle for the Lincoln Yards Industrial corridor could include the equity makeup of the construction crews and businesses, ESPECIALLY since DL3 Realty is leading a development initiative in Englewood with Sterling Bay/Lincoln Yards.

778,"Background materials were not available to the public, but a press packet was available.  I got a copy, probably 100+ pages.  It included summaries, renderings, drawings, etc.  I think it is important for documenters who go to the Plan Commission to pick up this packet.  If you sit in the gallery, you can't see the commissioners but you can see the slides.  If you sit in the press box, you can see the commissioners but not the slides, but most of the slides are in the packet.  I managed to speak with a commissioner, Linda Searle, afterward, who reinforced my impression that the commissioners do not know very much about what they are voting on, and follow the recommendations of staff, except under exceptional circumstances. So I do think decisions were made in advance, and that the commissioners are not well informed.

760,"I'm using this field to discuss Open Meetings Act issues. Apparently a door was locked at some point. I overheard someone saying many people were made to walk the long way around. The location was all the way in the back of a former hospital campus and it was hard to find. There was not sufficient parking near the location itself (there was more elsewhere on campus). There was no signage indicating where we should go, and the first time I went in the correct door I thought I had gone the wrong way as a result. I circled back, though. Upon exiting, I was faced with a gravely incline to get to my car. It was OK for me but would not have been ideal for some disabled people. As someone who coordinates events off-site as part of my job, it's not that hard to bring a few pre-printed signs and have someone call or run by to get accessibility details beforehand. 

This was one of the Board of Police Commissioners' community meetings, held at locations around the city. Well known Detroit activist Tawana Honeycomb Petty (@combsthepoet on twitter) has noted that many community members feel more comfortable coming to these meetings, as opposed to the ones at Public Safety Headquarters, where they feel unsafe.

But I also learned from public comments that the DBPC meetings at Public Safety Headquarters may be in violation of the OMA. They require ID for entry at the building, and they scan it so they may be keeping your info (They don't just look at it and hand it back). Having run public meetings myself in a past life, I thought you couldn't require people to give you their name or force them to sign in/record their info (nor would I want to, that's intimidating). If this is not a possibility for these meetings, perhaps they should host them all at other locations. Notably, anti-facial-recognition activist Meeko Williams was denied entry to a recend DBPC meeting at Public Safety Headquarters because he didn't have his state ID on him at the time. Meeko Williams was recently arrested at a Charter Commission hearing together with another activist, something that people have challenged at DBPC meetings, so there could conceivably be a grudge against him.",Detroit,Board of Police Commissioners,2019-08-10 00:45:07.500423+00

Also, the meeting started 10 minutes late. Some commissioners were later than 10 minutes. The meeting ended at 3:40, although scheduled to end at 3:30. The last speaker, referred to as Bureau Chief, was just rushed with maybe 5 minutes to present. The Bureau Chief had a slide presentation and seemed prepared. However, they were rushed for time. The content was number heavy, and I wish there was more time to discuss. The co-chair said the Bureau Chief will have an opportunity to speak at the next meeting, but the co-chair didn't want to end the meeting without at least giving the Bureau Chief a the floor for a brief moment.

721,"There was one man who made a great observation, he noted how even though some commissioners would against something, when it came time for voting, they would vote yes. He said that didn't make sense to him and he felt very under heard. Also, I think an investigation into security guards hired by CHA. There were complaints about a lack of training, as well as a lack of pay.

I do feel like that responsibility is on me—rather than on you guys. That’s why I’m not sure what, if anything, y’all should do differently. Maybe if we compiled a list of press contacts for each committee, then the process of reaching out to them would be easier? I feel like these are all things the Documenter can do themselves, though.

The final commenter of the evening was told she couldn't speak without a comment card, and when she said she hadn't seen them and asked ""Usually they're outside?"" the chair adjourned the meeting--that goes against the spirit if not the letter of the OMA. 

A member of the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners was arrested and physically dragged out of the meeting by multiple police officers, basically for speaking up loudly against facial recognition at new Chair Lisa Carter. Carter was opposed to any criticism. The only other Commissioner who asked her questions was also threatened by her and told he was out of order, when she had in fact recognized him to speak. She and police official David Levalley both threatened the public with removal and arrest. Levalley spent a lot of the public comment period texting. Most of the board was openly bored or glaring at the public commenters.

Not quite what you asked but that was a lot. I have attended and hosted many, many public meetings in my life, but I've never seen a board member arrested during a public meeting.

Re: audibility, speakers were somewhat difficult to hear at times, and in other cases officials spoke so quickly that no one could possibly comprehend what they were saying.

You really have to pay attention in the Cook County Commissioner meetings.  The Chair is often inaudible and commissioners are allowed to speak with staffers who are moving throughout the chamber, some taking pictures, speaking with public speakers etc.  There's a lot of side conversations, so focusing is paramount. 
Also, this meeting was about to start, was recessed and called again 1.25 hours later.  It lasted about 20 minutes. You have no idea which committee meeting people are in attendance for since the meetings run all day.

Also: After Samuels emphasized multiple times that nomination/election proceedings were conducted in line with Robert’s Rules, Joyce Chapman turned to us Documenters and joked that we should make sure to “put this on the blog.” Later, after remarking that she felt that “CPS isn’t giving the due respect to us as CACs,” she asked us bluntly, “Is this going on the blog?” Surprised and uncomfortable, I told that I was, indeed, taking notes on everything; she moved on but did mention us directly several more times in a way that implied that she didn’t fully understand what our purpose there was. This made me realize that it may be a good idea to give a longer description of the Documenters program when introducing myself at the beginning of meetings--although the amount to which she referred to us seemed indicative of an agency that is really not accustomed to outside reporters of any kind, no matter how much we clarified our purpose.

I also did not see print materials when I arrived, but none may have been provided as the only agenda item was a public hearing. As a general rule I try to have a copy on my phone.

At times members of the board seemed to not pay attention to the people making public comment they would be looking down at their phones or computer screens.

We should still learn of him since he's a frequent participant in these meetings, but perhaps we can characterize him with more respect to his problematic aspects as well as his virtues.

476,"I find it difficult to answer much of the above in a categorical way, so I have a few questions. Maybe that's just how this is, but please advise! 
- The issues were discussed at length, but does that mean they were adequately discussed? I'm not sure. As so many people noted throughout the day, there is overwhelming support for making better use of the land allotted for Lincoln Yards and The 78, but many questions as to how the land will be used and how projects will be funded. There was a lot of discussion, but a lot of confusion and obfuscation. 
- There were people protesting in what I would call a more ""official"" way, in a press conference prior to the meeting. Does that constitute active protest, even no one was really disrupting the proceedings? I would say that it was notable, given that protest clearly played some role in the decision to delay the votes. 
- I generally have trouble knowing whether I'm accurately answering the question about decisions being made in advance. The answer isn't usually just yes or no. In this case, it was clear that they'd decided not to vote on Lincoln Yards and The 78, but that still appeared up in the air throughout the meeting. It seemed to be arranged by Hopkins (according to his own comments to the press shortly before the meeting) that some committee member would move for a vote. That did eventually happen, though it wasn't successful. Other agenda items were discussed very little before being put to vote. That's partly because so much time had been spent on these two big issues, but also because the chair, presenters and committee members were all familiar with them. I'm not sure how questionable that is in all cases, but it doesn't seem good as a general practice.
- Related to the question above, there were issues of procedure. Certain proposals merit long discussion. But why, then, was there such a long agenda, with items that were destined not to be discussed thoroughly? It seemed like they were trying to cram in as many issues as possible, which is notable given the fact that it would be the last such meeting for a few committee members who were voted out. And why were there two more meetings scheduled that day in the chambers--one of which was rescheduled, and another that was relegated to a back room where no members of the public were present? In this and the last city council meeting I attended, committee members were arriving late and/or leaving early on their way to or from other meetings. It doesn't seem possible that aldermen are able to give due attention to each meeting, when their time is scheduled/stretched in this way. This is why I noted that officials weren't attentive and alert--many of them were, but many were only there for parts of the meeting. How should I note that? And there's a question to be explored: what are the solutions to these issues?
- Re: courtesy, officials were largely courteous but there were a handful of condescending comments, officials interrupting each other back and forth, and a generally heated tone. Would that be considered discourteous? I'm not sure where the important line is there. Relatedly, O'Connor appeared in control of the meeting, but it did go on for way too long. I'm just not sure if there was another way to handle it.
- Rules were possibly bent in two notable ways here: Public comment time was reduced to 2:00 minutes, because around 50 people had signed up; and the Rules committee meeting was moved to the room behind the chambers with little notice aside from an announcement from O'Connor, and no members of the public were present. 
- I noted that something went notably well because the votes on Lincoln Yards and The 78 were delayed, which many were asking for but did not necessarily expect. But is that an example of something going ""well,"" exactly?",Chicago,Committee on Finance,2019-04-09 15:43:01.090548+00

There's also an inconsistency between what's stated in the top in the document, and what's stated in the field guide--should it be single-spaced, or 1.15-spaced?

456,"For the most part, officials were courteous to the public, but there was one glaring point at which Chairperson Emma Mitts was not, and it hinges on a point at which there was a legitimate issue.  A full or almost-full board was there through the first two issues, the discussion of localizing liquor exemptions and of extending the pilot for mobile boutiques, but by the time individual alderpeople were bringing up requests for liquor license or liquor license moratoria in their wards, it was down to Chairperson Mitts and three other alderpeople on the committee.  A member of the public, George Blakemore, asked whether there was a quorum, expressed doubt that there was, and criticized them for operating without a quorum.  I don't know what the quorum is for this committee -- and, Chairperson Mitts did not respond to him with any information about what the quorum was.  In fact, she flippantly told him that there was a transportation meeting starting at 1pm, and perhaps he wanted to go and make comments at that meeting instead of this one.  That, I found terribly rude.

Tying to my mark in the survey, stating that I thought there were decisions made in advance?  Even the issues that were discussed for a long time, the mobile boutique issue and the localization of liquor license exemptions, were addressed by a perfunctory voice vote.   The individual ward requests had people present, and there was discussion on a few of them, but some of them had someone from the alderperson's office go forward and state their request, then a voice vote to approve, then move on.  For one (the 35th ward moratorium on liquor licenses along a stretch of Elston), it happened so quickly that Chairperson Mitts called for the vote before allowing public comment, which had been requested on that issue.  She then allowed public comment, but it was such poor form to do the vote *before* the requested public comment was allowed.

On the positive side, there was A LOT of background information publicly available online: the city portal had not only the agenda, but the full list of proposed issues, as well as PDFs with the text of those proposals for review before the meeting.

We were told that all of the presentations will be able online, but I have not been able to find them yet.  I did get the impression that the Land Bank is media friendly.

429,"Since most visits were to a school there was a process that must be followed. Generally, we met security near the entrance who was the first gatekeeper. After giving our spiel we were directed to the office. The office person would generally direct us to the Clerk or take our flyer. Making sure to reach out to the school beforehand with the intent on explaining City Bureau would allow the conversation to progress to building rapport. I found asking about what issues they cared about a tough question to get a response from; we were referred to reach out to the principals through email to get the Public Newsroom in their newsletter. 

With the business of the school, especially figuring out the best time to come, finding the perfect time to visit wasn't easy. During Afterschool programming speaking with more of the staff seemed much easier during school time, though it was still a very busy moment of the school day. Suggesting the best time and knowing who would be the ideal person at the school to speak with would have been strong support for any documenter.

Creating a ""spiel"" would be nice. Mine went as follows: "" Hi! My name is Cordell Longstreath and I am with City Bureau. We are a local Civic Journalism Lab on 6100 Dorchester that's mission is to democratize journalism by offering free and paid training programs. Our Public Newsroom, a free weekly training, is coming up on its 100th Newsroom and we are looking to celebrate with the community. This event will have musical guests, TV Legend Chic-a-Go-Go, Poet Eve Ewing, Cake, a costume party, and activity for all ages. I'm stopping by to invite the community to our free event to come and celebrate with us. "" This is before my ask and not including moments that I used to build rapport. Obviously, not every street team assignment will be specific to that pitch, but building a framework for this outreach aspect could really ease the tension of doing outreach.",Chicago,PN100: Street Team Flyering,2019-03-15 19:52:48.750684+00

It was at times hard to hear although there was a microphone at the podium.
Where do notetakers upload photos?
CCLBA experienced technical difficulties but continued to share about the selection process
An agenda was provided but no other materials.
If there's no Wi-Fi available (as was the case today) then it takes longer for notetakers to cut, paste, complete checklists, add links, etc.  Unless I'm just slow--I found 1.5 hours to be inadequate.
Have a place to indicate whether there are easily accessible outlets, wifi etc. at the locations (since they are recurring).

410,"As recommended, I wanted to get in touch beforehand with Nathan (my fellow Documenter on this project) but I didn't see his information listed in the assignment (I saw only his name in the assignment email I received). We did end up finding each other a few minutes before the event started, and as a new Documenter it was very nice to be on assignment with someone experienced. He suggested introducing ourselves to the guy running sound and video, which was a good tip. Nathan and I were able to work together collaboratively, filling in a gap here, answering a question for the other there, and taking ample photos between the two of us. 

Directions provided were correct, but at the meeting itself I did feel a little bit lost at points. Maybe that's to be expected at first. I'm not accustomed to attending board meetings, and at times found the language and process to be somewhat difficult to follow. I'm sure that will become clearer with time and practice. But it was a little more challenging to take good, detailed notes on 1.5 hours of information from two dozen speakers, when I wasn't entirely sure about the significance of each little thing happening. I would also note that most of the speakers were poorly mic'd at this event, and/or were not properly speaking into them (or at times not turning them on when speaking). Fortunately I met both the assistant board secretary and the deputy chief of staff, who offered to answer any questions we might have later on. 

Doing this for the first time, the pre-research and post-meeting writing of meeting notes took quite a bit longer than the allotted 1.5 hours. Partly that's because I struggled to discern how to pare the information down to 3 pages. I'm sure I will be able to streamline the process now that I have done it, but for me this first assignment was a full day of work. One note unrelated to this particular assignment: in looking through the field guide I noticed one of the links is bad. On the ""On Assignment - Web Research"" page, the link to elections.il.gov needs to be corrected (it came up as a 404 error). Otherwise the guidance provided beforehand (at training and in the online field guide) was quite helpful.",Chicago,Committee on Academic Affairs and Student Services,2019-03-08 00:24:08.936089+00
408,"They reorganized the meeting because the chancellor, Juan Salgado, was late. Other board members trickled in late as well. Helpful tips: talk to the IT guy if possible for WiFi. Also, the space-age entry gates on the first floor open automatically, which is not is intuitive as it should be (or perhaps I am a bit of a klutz--equal likelihood). Notably, they glossed over the sale of their old HQ. After the meeting, Asst Board Sec Ashley Kang explained that they were running around handing off the mic to each other at the meeting because they still weren't used to their new building and the configuration of their new meeting room (I may be mistaken, but I believe she referred to it as a ""tear-down""). I found it helpful to read up on the board members beforehand; Massey in particular has an impressive background. More broadly, it's interesting to see City Colleges of Chicago trying to work out its identity at a time when many fundamental assumptions about the nature, purpose, and financing of higher education are coming under scrutiny. One telling statistic that was also somewhat glossed over: of 100,000 alumni, they were only able to identify 150 potentially capable of donating 5K or more. CCC seems to have made strides, but not long ago, it had a graduation rate below 10%. Over the next ten to twenty years, it will be interesting to see if the system's current strategy yields dividends for students.

Some raised serious concerns about George Washington Elementary School's building; it might be worth following that to see what CPS does, and on what timeline.

If that's an issue, I could perhaps contact City Hall for an estimate of the total number of seats and base my guess off of it.

The meeting also lasted about 5 hours, and I didn't quite make until 6 pm (along with plenty of other people from the public, unfortunately).

It was peculiar to me that so many of the people speaking during public comment were contractors or consultants — who have already worked with Sterling Bay or may work with them going forward — it's almost like they packed the public comment part of the meeting.

It does amaze me how badly City Council is set up.  When you sit in the press box, it is really hard to hear people, and if you sit in the gallery, you cannot see any of the parties to the proposals.

Staff and board members zipped through their Rental Subsidy Program.  You had to follow on huge spreadsheet pages, which was very difficult to do while sitting on a chair away from the meeting table.  When the committee then went through their Multi-Family Affordable Upfront Investment (MAUI) program, they merely projected the relevant sections of their spreadsheet on the wall.  I spoke briefly with Thomas McNulty (the Board President), Annissa Lambirth-Garrett (the executive director), and Jason Sethen (the General Counsel), and they seemed accessible, though I was unable to get any of their email addresses, because they were heading off to a private meeting.  I asked Ms. Lambirth-Garrett for copies of the MAUI spreadsheet, which she agreed to email me (I uploaded it here).  Note that they had only like 1 copy of the agenda and the Rental Subsidy Program spreadsheet printout for the public, which I snatched up.  Ms. Lambirth-Garrett actually refused to give me copies until she let me into the meeting room only maybe 2 minutes before the meeting started.  My point is that I believe that would be possible for a Documenter to cultivate a relationship with these key members of the Trust Fund, and would then be able to report on the cases that they zip through really quickly during the meeting.

- Minutes from the last meeting were only available as a draft to the commission members. 
-  What seemed strange or amiss, aside from technical trouble looping in phone- attendees, was that no roll call for attendance occurred (per the agenda), and the issue of required quorum (members in attendance) came up repetitively for handling issues collectively. Despite this, it was later clarified by Jeanine Stroger, and Mary (another commissioner).

The thing I wanted to make sure to note, since it may be worth further investigation or coverage, is the resolution that passed, allowing the chief medical officer to have arresting powers.  They discussed the specificity of naming the actual person in the role versus more generally naming the chief medical officer as having that authority -- but what they didn't discuss, and what would be both good to know and good to scrutinize, is how broad that arresting power is, and when it can actually be used.

 It's tempting for committee members to use these meetings to congratulate each other on their projects.  On the one hand, some are unsung and deserve congrats.

Biggest barrier was lack of practical access to their wi-fi.  They did send a code to get in but I had trouble receiving it.

2. I printed the questionnaire for the interview because there was no Internet connection. I admit I did not spend enough time to learn the questions, so I messed up some of them, for example, the question: ""Did you vote/will you vote in the…"" Select all that apply. I did not provide the options, so I asked the interviewee if she will vote for the municipal election. The answer I provided here in the form is based on the interviewee's answer to other questions: November 2018 election.

I think, it will be great, if next time, City Bureau provides a printer friendly form (a PDF form) of the questionnaire that includes the choices of answers.

(Paging thru the former, I ended up missing a question.) So, for next time, I suggest a downloadable text file of all the questions.

2. Advertised length: CB advertised the interview length as one hour. Neither of my interviews went more than 30 minutes. Many people I asked for interviews didn't respond, or refused--and at least one said (correctly) that an hour seemed too long.

3. On-line Documenter list: I suggest you alphabetize CB's drop-down menu of Documenter names. Each time, it's taken me a long time to find my name.

There were three separate periods where I changed the mic volume on the H4N Handy recorder because, in monitoring the decibels, sometimes it was at levels dangerous for interference. If you need audio from those sections, you can easily adjust the decibel level in a program like Audition.

Later on, I was able to get a better seat closer to the speakers and kept the mic volume up.

Food was provided, so early on, particularly during the lengthy introductions section, you may hear the sounds of people around the room eating, fiddling with papers, etc. 

One last note: while I arrived early and had a separate file to capture ambient room noise for cleaning up the audio, R.A.G.E. was unfortunately playing some pretty loud music while people filtered into the room, so it’s pretty much useless. 

I also included the .WAV file instead of an .mp3, as it's better for pure audio production. The .mp3s undergo compression and lose some of their quality. The result is a massive 1.36 GB file. I'm not sure it uploaded completely, so if it didn't, I can either cut it up into smaller files and upload those separately, or convert it into an .mp3. Get in touch with me!
