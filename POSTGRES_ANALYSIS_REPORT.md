# PostgreSQL Database Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully connected to the PostgreSQL database and verified that the feedback data matches the CSV file with 99.96% accuracy.

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Structure
- **Primary feedback table**: `assignments_submission` 
- **Feedback field**: `notes` column (not in JSON data field as initially expected)
- **Total records**: 16,423 submissions across 24 programs
- **Date range**: October 2018 to July 2025

### 2. Data Accuracy Verification
- **Total submissions match**: PostgreSQL (16,423) vs CSV (16,416) - Difference of only 7 records
- **Filled feedback match**: PostgreSQL (5,648) vs CSV (5,644) - Difference of only 4 records  
- **Fill rate match**: Both show 34.4% overall fill rate
- **Program-level accuracy**: 23 out of 24 programs match exactly

### 3. Table Relationships
```
assignments_submission → assignments_role → assignments_assignment → accounts_program
      (feedback)           (via role_id)      (via assignment_id)     (via program_id)
```

### 4. SQL Query for Program Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
    p.name as program_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) as total_submissions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN s.notes IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(s.notes) != '' 
        THEN s.id 
    END) as filled_feedback,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
        WHEN s.notes IS NULL OR TRIM(s.notes) = '' 
        THEN s.id 
    END) as blank_feedback
FROM assignments_submission s
JOIN assignments_role r ON s.role_id = r.id
JOIN assignments_assignment a ON r.assignment_id = a.id
JOIN accounts_program p ON a.program_id = p.id
WHERE p.active = true
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY total_submissions DESC
```

## Scripts Created

1. **`test_postgres_connection.py`** - Initial connection test and schema exploration
2. **`analyze_postgres_feedback.py`** - First analysis attempt, discovered table structure
3. **`analyze_postgres_program_feedback.py`** - Program-level analysis with error handling
4. **`analyze_postgres_program_feedback_fixed.py`** - Corrected version that found the feedback data
5. **`final_postgres_csv_comparison.py`** - Comprehensive comparison showing data accuracy

## Conclusion

The PostgreSQL database contains accurate feedback data that matches the CSV file. The `notes` column in the `assignments_submission` table stores the documenter feedback, and the data can be reliably queried for program-level statistics.
